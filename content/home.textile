h2. About

This is a _minimalist_ web site: I do not care about fancy graphics or nitfy effects. I do care, however, about content and I want you to read what I write comfortably. As you can see, this site has no sidebars: it only has a header, a main column and a footer, exactly where you expect them to be.

This site was designed to work with all the major modern browsers (hint: Internet Explorer 6 is _not_ a modern browser). It validates as XHTML 1.1 Strict and CSS 2.1.


h3. Under the Hood

This site is powered by:

* -A customized version of the "Typo":http://www.typosphere.org blogging engine.-
* -The "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org web framework for the "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org programming language.-
* -The "MySQL":http://www.mysql.com database engine.-
* -The "Apache":http://www.apache.org web server.-
* Just "Nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/, <em>"[...] a site compiler written in Ruby for building awesome web sites."</em>
