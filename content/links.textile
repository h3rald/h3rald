This pages is a collection of useful links. It's not exactly a blogroll because it does not contain just blogs, and it's not really a place to display reciprocal links, simply because most of the links are not reciprocal at all.

You can't really ask or pay to be on this page, what you _can_ do is make your site interesting enough that I'll feel obliged to list it here. I don't really visit any of these web sites often, I normally read their feeds regularly in "Google Reader":http://www.google.com/reader, so they are categorized according to the Google Reader folders I use.
