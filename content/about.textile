H3RALD.com was created in 2004 by Fabio Cevasco, a technical writer, programmer and IT enthusiast. It features over a hundred "articles":/archives/ covering a wide range of topics, from programming to writing, productivity and traveling.

As of version 8, H3RALD.com is a completely static web site, except for a few AJAX calls. All the files are generated automatically thanks to the "nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ publishing system, an ingenious creation of "Denis Defreyne":http://www.stoneship.org/. Nanoc can be used to easily create static web sites using Ruby, as explained in "this article":http://www.h3rald.com/articles/take-back-your-site-with-nanoc/.
