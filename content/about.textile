h2. About this Web Site

This is a _minimalist_ web site: I do not care about fancy graphics or nitfy effects. I do care, however, about content and I want you to read what I write comfortably. As you can see, this site has no sidebars: it only has a header, a main column and a footer, exactly where you expect them to be.

This site was designed to work with all the major modern browsers (hint: Internet Explorer 6 is _not_ a modern browser). It validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS 2.1.

h3. About Me

I am a full-time technical writer working in Genoa, Italy. In my free time I enjoy writing (surprise, surprise), reading about technology and programming a little bit in Ruby and other languages.

h3. About the name "H3RALD"

Why "H3RALD"? Well, this dates back to 2003. Back in the day I was trying to find a username I could user everywhere on the 'Net that wasn't something like FabioCev83 or SomeRandomCoolGuy777. I wanted something unique, easy to remember and not too silly if possible. 

At the time I was also an avid reader of the "International Herald Tribune":http://www.iht.com/, mainly  because it was the only foreign paper I could buy near my house. So I tried using "herald" for some services, but sadly it was obviously taken. Finally, I thought about turning the E into a 3, and there we are, the name H3RALD was born and I used ever since.
