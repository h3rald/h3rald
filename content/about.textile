 <span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a _minimalist_ web site: I do not care about fancy graphics or nitfy effects. I do care, however, about content and I want you to read what I write comfortably. As you can see, this site has no sidebars: it only has a header, a main column and a footer, exactly where you expect them to be. The source code of this site follows W3C's XHTML 1.1 and CSS 2.1 standard.
 
As of version 8, h3rald.com is a completely static web site, except for a few AJAX calls. All the files are generated automatically thanks to the "Nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ publishing system, an ingenious creation of "Denis Defreyne":http://www.stoneship.org/. Nanoc can be used to easily create static web sites using Ruby, as explained in "this article":http://www.h3rald.com/articles/creating-static-web-sites-with-nanoc.

h3. Requirements

The following ruby libraries (gems) have been used to create this web site:

* *"nanoc3":http://rubyforge.org/projects/nanoc/*, to generate the entire web site
* *"extlib":http://rubyforge.org/projects/extlib/*, in some custom Rake tasks
* *"bb-ruby":http://rubyforge.org/projects/bb-ruby/*, for the BBCode filter
* *"builder":http://rubyforge.org/projects/builder/*, to create RSS and ATOM feeds
* *"haml":http://rubyforge.org/projects/haml/*, for the SASS filter

Additionally, the following gems were necessary to migrate from the previous version of this web site, powered by "Typo":http://www.typosphere.org:
* *"mysql":http://rubyforge.org/projects/mysql/*, to connect to the MySQL database used by Typo
* *"sequel":http://rubyforge.org/projects/sequel/*, to retrieve data from the Typo database

Besides Ruby-related dependencies, the following was also necessary:

* *"pygments":http://pygments.org/*, a Python library for code highlighting
* A cron job to fetch backtype comments, delicious bookmarks, tweets, and github commits in JSON format and save them to the @/output/data@ folder.
