H3RALD.com was created in 2004 by Fabio Cevasco, a system architect, technical writer, programmer and IT enthusiast. It features over a hundred "articles":/archives/ covering a wide range of topics, from programming to writing, productivity and traveling.

As of version 8, H3RALD.com is a completely static web site, except for a few AJAX calls. All the files are generated automatically thanks to the "nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org/ publishing system, an ingenious creation of "Denis Defreyne":http://www.stoneship.org/. Nanoc can be used to easily create static web sites using Ruby, as explained in "this article":http://www.h3rald.com/articles/take-back-your-site-with-nanoc/.

The following ruby libraries (gems) are used to compile this web site:

* "nanoc":https://rubygems.org/gems/nanoc, to generate the entire web site
* "Extlib":https://rubygems.org/gems/extlib, in some custom Rake tasks
* "BB-Ruby":https://rubygems.org/gems/bb-ruby, for BBCode support
* "Builder":https://rubygems.org/gems/builder/, to create RSS and ATOM feeds
* "Less":https://rubygems.org/gems/less/, for the SASS filter
* "The Ruby Racer":https://rubygems.org/gems/therubyracer, to execute Javascript code (needed by Less)
* "RedCloth":https://rubygems.org/gems/redcloth/, for Textile support
* "RDiscount":https://rubygems.org/gems/rdiscount, for Markdown support
* "Glyph":https://rubygems.org/gems/glyph, for Glyph support
