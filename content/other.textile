This is a repository for other pages and sections that are somehow unrelated to the rest of the web site. In other words, anything that is not an "article":/archives/ or a "project":/projects/ goes here so that it doesn't get lost.

- "Links":/links/ := A collection of useful links to other web sites that I consider interesting, to some degree.
- "Holidays":/holidays/ := Information on my family house in the countryside near Bogliasco, Genoa (IT); available for rent.
