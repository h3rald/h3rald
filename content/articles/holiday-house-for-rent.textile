Part of my family house in the countryside is now available for rent! It's located in the small village of "Sessarego":http://italia.indettaglio.it/eng/liguria/genova_bogliasco_sessarego.html, a few minutes away from the coast, on the Italian Riviera.
We've been living there recently for 6 months when I started working and then moved to the city in order to be nearer to my workplace, but we still go there on holidays or on the odd week end, sometimes.

The house is fully furnished, it has been recently renovated, and offers all major comforts and services (utilities, TV, internet, phone, etc.). It can be ideal as a holiday house for writers, programmers, or anyone who would like to take a break from the chaotic city life without giving up all the commodities of modern life, such as the Internet.
