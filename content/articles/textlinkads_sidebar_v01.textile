I thought it would be nice to share the code of the sidebar I created to display "Text Link Ads":http://www.text-links-ads.com sponsor links on my Typo powered blog.

There's actually another "plugin":http://blog.nanorails.com/articles/2006/10/01/a-new-rails-plugin-for-textlinkads-including-support-for-feedvertising which was made for Typo 2.6, but unfortunately it doesn't work with Typo 4.1.1.

h3. Installation

Just unzip it inside your vendor/plugins directory. The new sidebar should appear in the list of your available sidebars in the Typo's administration area.

h3. Configuration

In Typo's administration area, configure the following settings for this sidebar:

* *Title*: The title of the sidebar
* *KEY*: Your TLA's XML key
* *Affiliate ID*: Your TLA's affiliate ID
* *Advertise Here*: A message shown when no links are displayed.
