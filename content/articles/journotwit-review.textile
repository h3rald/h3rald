Since I started using "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com on a regular basis, I started feeling overwhelmed by the endless stream of data generated by the people I was following.

The official twitter page quickly became inadequate to manage my tweets, so I began to search for an alternative through the myriad of Twitter clients available out there, both web and desktop based. After trying out a few desktop clients, I decided to restrict the search to web clients only: between work and home, I may use up to 4 different computers and 3 different operating system, and I really didn't fancy the idea of keeping the _same_ client up to date everywhere -- even admitting that such client existed.

Over the past months I tried dozens of different web-based Twitter clients, and narrowed the list of _must-have_ features to the following:
* The interface should be simple to use and not too cluttered.
* I should be able to categorize tweets in columns (a-la TweetDeck).
* I should be able to know, when visiting the site, how many _new_ tweets I have to go through.
* I should be able to mark tweets as read.
* It should display media files (at least pictures) inline with the tweets.
* The interface should provide all the most common twitter actions like reply, retweet, follow/unfollow, shorten url, upload pictures etc. etc.

The good news is that I found at least _one_ web-based client able to do all this: "JournoTwit":http://www.journotwit.com.
