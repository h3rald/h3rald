%(dropcap)I% just updated the "Herald Vim color scheme":/herald-vim-color-scheme/ to improve the readability of delimiters and search results.

Delimiters are now red (the same color as operators) instead of yellow, so that you can tell the start and end of a string or regular expression more easily. Additionally, search results are no longer highlighted with black text on an orange background for two reasons:
* the orange background is a bit too strong
* the black foreground causes letters to become _completely hidden_ by the _cursorline_ and _cursorcolumn_

Search results now have a gray background and a yellow background, as shown in the screenshot on the right.

If you have any constructive suggestion on how to improve this color scheme, don't hesitate to add a comment to this post!
