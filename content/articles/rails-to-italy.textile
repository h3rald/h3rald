So it looks like there will be a "Rails conference in Italy", after all. In Pisa as well, and that's maybe even less than 2 hours drive from where I live (Genoa)!

_Sounds cool!_

Well, the entrance fee put me off a bit, I daresay (â‚¬89 if you book before August 1st, more otherwise), but it would be great to go there.
They are actually looking for speakers too, pity that at the moment I don't have anything prepared, but who knows... There's free entrance (and beer) for speakers, apparently, which it wouldn't be bad, but unfortunately my girlfriend would have to pay though, of course.

We'll see what happens, for now I'm just going to promote the thing on my site (see the banner on the side).
