When the SitePoint staff asked me to write an article summing up all the new features of Firefox 3, I gladly accepted: I wrote about Firefox before, and I thought it was just going to be a 2-3 hours job maximum. 
After diving deeper into Firefox 3 development, reading dozens of different blogs and scouting Mozilla's web sites, I realized I was wrong: Firefox 3 introduced _a lot_ of new things, and keeping track of all of them, I admit, was quite a hard task.

Nevertheless, I wrote the article and delivered it to SitePoint in time fore the release, but my editor "complained" that 8,300+ words was about 3 times over the minimum requirements for a feature article! 
_"I don't really think that people can read the whole thing online"_ &mdash;, he said, and I somehow agreed.

In the end, they decided to pack my "article" into a 30-pages PDF eBook which can be downloaded _absolutely free of charge_ from SitePoint web site as well, so here it is:

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> *"Firefox 3 Revealed":http://firefox.s3.sitepoint.com/ff3-revealed.zip* </span> 

If you prefer though, you can still read the article directly on SitePoint, "here":http://www.sitepoint.com/article/firefox-3-whats-new-whats-hot.

This guide aims to give you a comprehensive overview of virtually _all_ the new features and improvements introduced by Firefox 3.

I would like to thank the whole SitePoint staff for giving me the opportunity to write this eBook, and in particular *"Matthew Magain":http://magain.com/blog/* for his help and support (and for creating the PDF on a Sunday evening!).
Additionally, I would also like to thank the Mozilla Development Team for their awesome job with Firefox 3 and everyone else who made this eBook possible.

*Update:* Feel free to *"digg":http://digg.com/software/FireFox_3_Revealed_Free_ebook_from_SitePoint* this eBook!
