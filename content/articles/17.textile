Gustavo Carreno just "announced":http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/4e13231cc383b9bb/6414184c1058fadb#6414184c1058fadb a new release of the "CakePHP Offline Manual":http://cakeforge.org/frs/?group_id=53&release_id=82. Personally I was extremely happy to download this new release because it finally contains documentation and howtos related to CakePHP's Model Associations, which is perhaps one of the most used _advanced_ CakePHP features.
So I'll have no excuses not to learn how to use them, great...

The manual is available in the following formats:

* Windows compressed HTML (.chm)
* PDF
* HTML (multiple pages or single page)

Furthermore, the CakePHP API is also available for download in .chm format, thanks to  Mladen Mihajlovic.

Well done guys. Really useful for people like me who are on dialup sometimes :)
