I've been kindly asked by the lead developer of "RubyInLine":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/ to change the name of my "InLine":http://rubyforge.org/projects/inline/ project, due to potential confusion and conflicts.

This makes sense, and I'm ready to change the name of my project, although I'm not that good at choosing original and _smart_ names, so well, any suggestion is more than welcome!

I was thinking of something like:

* RawLine
* EditLine
* RawInput
* RubyInput
* RubyLine

I personally think that *RawLine* is probably the best option, but please, if have any better idea just speak up!

P.S.: "RedLine" is taken, unfortunately, otherwise it would have been my first choice since the beginning.
