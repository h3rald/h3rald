    Very nice.
    
    I also appreciate a color scheme that degrades elegantly to low-color modes, so that I can use the essentially same scheme even when I'm remotely logged in. Degrading to 256 is good, but can you degrade to 16? I use baycomb for exactly this reason; it's honestly not as nice as your scheme (for example, it doesn't highlight the cursor row and column), but it does have a lot of features, and it smoothly degrades to lower numbers of colors.

  :body: I still find Desert to be the best universal color theme for VIM. It works for any language and it distinguishes between more text elements than any other theme I have tried.

    @Wm Tanksley:
    I will make it degrade to 16 colors, even if it won't look great, obviously... I'll try my best.
    
    @Mario:
    Thanks for pointing out desert: I personally don't like it much, but I can check it out to see what elements it highlights and how.

  :body: Brilliant scheme - you are enabling my laziness by doing such a good job I can now cross off of my todo list the task of customizing my own further. Thanks.

    Nice color scheme. I tried using moria as well, and you've fixed the biggest downside (to me, at least), which is to intrusive comments.
    
    Your vimrc file also gave me a lot of inspiration, by the way :)

  :body: Looks good, but the visual mode lacks contrast (for me).

  :body: Hey, that's the first theme I see which doesn't seem to suck when using `cursorline` and `cursorcolumn`. Thanks!

  :body: It does look incredibly colorful. I don't know if I'll like it, but I will give it a spin. I am using ir_black at the moment.

I use "Vim":http://www.vim.org a lot. It's my editor of choice when I code (mainly in Ruby), and also when I write my blog post and articles (mainly in Textile).
One thing I always liked about Vim was it powerful syntax highlighting: there's probably a syntax highlighting file for every programming language ever created, even the new ones ("Nimrod":http://force7.de/nimrod/index.html? Sure, "here":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2632!).

Furthermore, Vim allows you to create color schemes, and that's surprisingly easy to do. Everything you need to do is in the "docs":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html, but that may put you off, so you can just start by editing an existing one -- that's what I did.h3. InfiniteRed Black

I've been using the "ir_black":http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/8 color scheme for near enough a year. It's an excellent color scheme, recommended especially for writing Ruby code:

!=/images/herald.vim/ir_black_vim_example.png! 

I honestly thought this was the best Vim color scheme until I discovered Moria...

h3. Moria

Recently I switched to "moria":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1464, mainly because I find it easier on the eyes. It's a matter of taste, of course:

!=/images/herald.vim/moria_vim_example.png! 

The trick is in the background: it's not completely black. Still, I didn't quite like the colors, so I decided to write my own...

h3. Herald

Meet <strong> "herald.vim":/files/herald.vim </strong> (this is a direct link to the raw file, but you may also want to check my "stash":http://github.com/h3rald/stash/tree/master on GitHub or the "script page":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2684 on Vim.org):

!=/images/herald.vim/herald_vim_example.png! 

To sum up, here's the _features_ offered by this new color scheme:
* It's easier to differentiate syntax elements; in particular reserved words like @if@ or @end@, constants (symbols) and identifiers (instance variables).
* Operators are highlighted and easier to notice.
* Dark gray background and black column/row selectors.
* Added highlight for titles (useful for Textile)
* Comments do not stand out, unlike in most color schemes
* Support for 256 color terminal (special thanks to "Wolfgang Frisch":http://www.frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/ for providing all the info and tools required)

So what do you think? Is it tool colorful perhaps? How would *you* improve it?
