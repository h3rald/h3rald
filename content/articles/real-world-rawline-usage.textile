So I finally decided to update "RawLine":/rawline last week, and I added a more Readline-like API. When I first started the project, I was determined _not_ to do that, because the current Readline wrapper shipped with Ruby is not very Ruby-ish: it's a wrapper, after all!

The good thing of having a new API compatible with Readline is that now people can use RawLine in their Readline-powered scripts, with very minor modifications.

Let's have a look at some examples (they are also shipped with "Rawline v0.3.1":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rawline):
h3. Rush

"Rush":http://rush.heroku.com is an excellent gem which provides a cross-platform shell environment, entirely written in Ruby.
Being a shell, it obviously uses Readline for tab completion, and that does the job on Linux. On Windows though, things aren't that easy: 

* text gets garbled if you write long lines
* you can't type certain characters if they use some key modifiers like <RIGHT-ALT>, etc.

RawLine doesn't have these problems (that's the very reason why I created it), so here's a simple script which launches a Rawline-enabled Rush shell:

<typo:code lang="ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'rush'
require 'rawline'

class RawlineRush < Rush::Shell

	def initialize
		Rawline.basic_word_break_characters = "" 
		Rawline.completion_proc = completion_proc
		super
	end

	def run
		loop do
			cmd = Rawline.readline('rawline_rush> ')
			finish if cmd.nil? or cmd == 'exit'
			next if cmd == ""
			Rawline::HISTORY.push(cmd)
			execute(cmd)
		end
	end
end

shell = RawlineRush.new.run
</typo:code>

What happens here? Nothing much really, all I had to do was:

# Derive a new class from Rush::Shell
# Set <code>Rawline.basic_word_break_characters</code> to the same value used in the original Rush code
# Set <code>Rawline.completion_proc</code> to _the same_ completion Proc used in the original Rush code
# Rewrite the original <code>run</code> replacing <code>Readline</code> with <code>Rawline</code>

And it works as it was intended to, i.e. typing <code>root['b<TAB></code> will expand to <code>root['bin/</code>, etc.
Note that I didn't write the completion Proc from scratch: it was already there.

h3. IRB

After trying out Rush, the next logical step was trying IRB itself: I could never use it properly on Windows, and that was really frustrating.
After a few minutes trying to figure out how to start IRB programmatically, I quickly came up with a similar example:

<typo:code lang="ruby">
require 'irb'
require 'irb/completion'
require 'rubygems'
require 'rawline'

Rawline.basic_word_break_characters= " \t\n\"\\'`><;|&{(" 
Rawline.completion_append_character = nil
Rawline.completion_proc = IRB::InputCompletor::CompletionProc

class RawlineInputMethod < IRB::ReadlineInputMethod
	include Rawline
	def gets
		if l = readline(@prompt, false)
			HISTORY.push(l) if !l.empty?
			@line[@line_no += 1] = l + "\n"
		else
			@eof = true
			l
		end
	end
end

module IRB
	@CONF[:SCRIPT] = RawlineInputMethod.new
end
IRB.start
</typo:code>

In this case, Rawline is included in the <code>RawlineInputMethod</code> class, derived from the original <code>ReadlineInputMethod</code> class, i.e. the class IRB uses to define (guess...) how to input characters.
Again, all I had to do was set a few Rawline variables to match the ones used in Readline, and then redefine the function used to get characters. All done. 

It works as expected (only with inline completion, of course): typing <code>"test".ma<TAB></code> will give you <code>"test".map</code>, <code>"test".match</code>, etc.

You also get all Rawline key mappings for free (CTRL-K to clear the line, CTRL-U and CTRL-R to undo and redo, etc.), and you can define your own.
