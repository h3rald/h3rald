Tutorials are great, articles are helpful, manuals are essential and the API is your best friend, but there's still something missing there... Unfortunately podcasts are not yet available, but the CakePHP team is proud to announce the creation of two "screencasts":http://cakephp.org/pages/screencasts in an effort to help new bakers familiarizing with CakePHP's concepts. 
This is old news now, the screencasts section came together with the "site overhaul":http://base--/blog/view/24 but I only got a chance to take a look at them (one of them only, to be totally honest) recently, and so here's a spoil... erhm, a _detailed_ description of John Anderson's screencast about the "Blog Tutorial":http://manual.cakephp.org/chapter/18.

There's something I'll never do: a screencast. Recording every mouse movement, every word or piece of code typed in half an hour? No way! And what happens if I mistype something? People will keep pointing out the fact that I was starting to type @</h2>@ to close a @</h1>@ tag, or that I waited an eternity like five full seconds before deciding what to do. I guess I'm quite paranoid... John did it, and he did it well. Using just bash, vim and Safari he was able to record an excellent 30-minutes screencast featuring the blog tutorial. 
Before people start complaining that the blog tutorial should be completed in fifteen minutes, keep in mind that John's screencast is meant to show everything clearly to new users, via a trial and error approach if necessary.

Here's what happens in the screencast, nothing new if your read the blog tutorial, but still interesting, especially if you're new to Cake. Unfortunately there's no audio, but the video talks by itself and John will occasionally write some comments here and there.
