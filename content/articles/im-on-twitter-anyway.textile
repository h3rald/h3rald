I've been neglecting my blog, I know. The truth is that I'm quite busy in this period: I have more responsibilities in my daily full-time jobs, my lunch breaks are getting shorter and I don't have much free time. At any rate, here's what's going on:

* I'm writing a new article for an online magazine (assuming I'm gonna finish it)
* I signed up for a freelance technical reviewing job, for a new Ruby book which will come out soon-ish
* I'm getting ready to finally visit Rome (again), this time with my fianc√©e, for our fifth anniversary.
* I'm slowly preparing a version 1.0 of "RedBook":http://code.google.com/p/redbook/, which involves quite a lot of refactoring (and hopefully better documentation and tests). 
* I'm trying to learn a little bit of Haskell: it seems to be one of the few non .NET languages able to produce standalone .exe files, nowadays...

Last but not least, I now decided to use "Twitter":http://twitter.com regularly, so you can follow me "there":http://twitter.com/h3rald/, if you wish!
