<p>Glyph's primary goal is to author complex documents like books or manuals. In order to do so, a Glyph project is
	required to keep everything organized and automated via a set of predefined conventions, exactly like Ruby on Rails
	or other similar frameworks do.</p>
<p>If you want to write a one-page article or a short draft, however, creating and managing Glyph projects can be an
	unnecessary burden. Luckily, you don't have to: you can use Glyph to compile single files containing Glyph code, by
	adding one parameter (or two if you want to specify a custom destination file) to the <a
		href="/glyph/book/ref_commands.html#c_compile"><code>compile</code></a> command, like this:</p>
<p>
	<code>glyph compile source.glyph destination.htm</code>
</p>
<p>This command will process a file called <code>source.glyph</code> and produce an HTML file called
	<code>destination.htm</code>.</p>

	</header>
	<p>This sort of &#8220;lite&#8221; mode comes with a few minor limitations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Snippets can only be defined inside the source file, using the <a
				href="/glyph/book/macros/macros_core.html#m_snippet_"><code>snippet:</code></a> macro.</li>
		<li>Project configuration settings can only be defined inside the source file, using the <a
				href="/glyph/book/macros/macros_core.html#m_config_"><code>config:</code></a> macro.</li>
		<li>Custom macros can only be defined inside the source file, using the <a
				href="/glyph/book/macros/macros_core.html#m_macro_"><code>macro:</code></a> macro.</li>
		<li>Images must be referenced with their absolute path, or a path relative to the current directory, and will
			not be copied anywhere when the output file is generated.</li>
		<li>Stylesheets must be referenced with their absolute path, or a path relative to the current directory, or the
			name of an existing Glyph <a href="/glyph/book/text_editing/stylesheets.html#default_stylesheets">system
				stylesheet</a>.</li>
		<li>The files included through the <a
				href="/glyph/book/macros/macros_core.html#m_include"><code>include</code></a> macro must be referenced
			with their absolute path, or a path relative to the current directory.</li>
	</ul>
