    <p>One of the many things that really bothered me about my web site was the fact that it didn&#8217;t look good on my iPhone, or any small screen for that matter.</p>
<p>Years ago I <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">read about</a> responsive web design, media queries, etc., but I never had the will or the time to dive into the subject. Then <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> came out, and it changed <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Not only Bootstrap provides a very solid <span class="caps">HTML</span> boilerplate and grid system, it also comes with some very nice and complete styles for every <span class="caps">HTML</span> element, a few Javascript-enhanced UI components, and  best of all it is fully responsive.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t remember the exact day when I started using a todo list in a serious way. It definitely happened at work, but I can&#8217;t remember when exactly. The point is that, once I started working (and getting paid for what I love doing &ndash; writing), I slowly turned into a real <em>productivity freak</em>.</p>
<p>I write <em>everything</em> down. My colleagues know that if I say that I&#8217;ll do something <em>right now</em> but I don&#8217;t do it within five minutes, they have to assume that I forgot about it altogether and they&#8217;d better send me an email.</p>
<p>I am not a paper person. Never been one. When I got a job which consisted in working on the computer for eight hours a day, I started looking for todo list programs. That turned into an endless quest: I tried X for a few weeks, then I discovered that Y was better, used it for months, then moved onto Z, and so on.</p>

    <p>Obie did it, again. With the second edition of his former masterpiece, <em>The Rails Way</em>, he managed to outdo himself delivering a new, even more useful, Rails Bible. Wether you&#8217;re a Ruby on Rails professional like him or just an enthusiast, this book is pretty much everything you need to learn how to master the third release of DHH&#8217;s Ruby web framework.</p>
<p><a href="http://tr3w.com/">The Rails 3 Way</a> is no ordinary second edition. If you already own <em>The Rails Way</em>, you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised that this is a different, more polished book. While something had to remain the same, there&#8217;s a lot of new content in its 708 pages, and even the old content has been rewritten or at least revised.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you already know Rails 2.x or you&#8217;re jumping straight into the Rails 3 world, if you use Rails, you can&#8217;t miss this book.</p>

		<h2><a href="/articles/reflections-on-management/">Book Review: Reflections on Management</a></h2>
		
			<h3>The key to becoming a true leader</h3>

    <p>When I was offered to review this book, I was a bit skeptical: a book on <em>management</em>? I normally read and review books on programming and software development methodologies. However, I work as a Documentation Technical Leader, and while I don&#8217;t technically <em>manage</em> a whole team yet (damn economic crisis!), someday I may end up doing just that, so I gave <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=032171153X">Reflections on Management</a> a try.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s short, after all, I&#8217;ll probably read it in a couple of weeks and move on</em> &mdash; I thought. Well, beware of short books: I thought exactly the same thing when I picked up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a>, and it still follows me around everywhere, so that I can re-read bits of it whenever I need to.</p>
