I consider myself a _hacker_ in the true meaning of the word:

> "A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."

&mdash; Eric S. Raymond, <cite><a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">The Jargon File</a></cite>

I am a passionate programmer and open source advocate, a technology enthusiast and a devoted Star Trek fan. Throughout my professional career I have been working as a developer, technical writer, software architect, and product manager.

Lately I have progressively abandoned social networks and started a never-ending quest for high-quality, thought-provoking and life-enriching content on the Internet. If I am finding anything interesting, I am posting it on [2c.fyi](https://2c.fyi), which is my own personal URL-shortener/micro blog/bookmark manager.

I have also built my own ecosystem of little tools I needed, and I find it very rewarding. I am growing more and more dissatisfied with the current state of popular software programs, always bloated and always connected, and I guess I am trying to do something about that in my own way.

These days, the best way to contact me is through good old-fashioned email: basically it's this domain without the TLD at the domain.
