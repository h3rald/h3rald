<p>When it comes to software, I definitely like to try out new things. My collegues takes the piss out of me because
    every <del>week</del> day I come up with &#8220;some new tool they <em>have</em> to start using&#8221; and so
    on.<br />
    As a matter of fact, I like reviewing software as well. I enjoy writing and analyzing new things, evaluating all the
    new possibilities they may offer, and I also tend to have a rather critical eye for what doesn't <em>feel</em>
    right. I'll use a tool for months but still try out new ones which claim to do the same thing — but better — as they
    come out.<br />
    Unfortunately — or fortunately, depends how you look at it — when it comes to software, there are very few
    <em>silver bullets</em>, and things keep changing: that's the way it is and the way it will be.</p>
<p>I must try to write up a page (and ideally update it regularly, that's the hard part) listing all the tools I use, at
    some point&#8230; but at any rate, if you coded some new app you think kicks ass or you found a hidden jewel in the
    labyrinth of freeware, just let me know: I'll definitely try it out, and if it's worth a post I'll blog about it.
</p>
<p><strong>The same applies to books</strong>, actually, as I like reading, especially those which are related to Ruby
    or programming, nowadays.</p>
<p>The cost of such reviews and articles? Depends! Certainly I wouldn't mind donations or some compensation of some
    form, especially from publishers or software companies. It may be money, books, software or even nothing: it really
    depends on what I have to review.<br />
    Please be aware that I am <strong>not</strong> doing this full time, and I already have a job and a fiancée to look
    after, but I'll do my best to publish as much as I can on my site or even elsewhere elsewhere [Note: on e-zines,
    magazines &amp; similar, not on your brother's friend's mother-in-law's crappy blog!].</p>
