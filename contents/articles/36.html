<p><em><strong>Italy has won the World Cup!</strong></em></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if Zidane first scored on a totally unfair penalty kick at the 7th minute and then, totally
    out of his mind, headbutted Materazzi&#8230; WE <span class="caps">WON</span>, <span class="caps">AND</span> WE
    <span class="caps">KICKED</span> <span class="caps">THEIR</span> <span class="caps">ASS</span>, end of story :)</p>

    <p>&#8220;Italy beat France 5-3 in a penalty shoot-out to win the World Cup after an absorbing 1-1 draw in Berlin.

    <p>Fabio Grosso scored the winning goal after France&#8217;s David Trezeguet missed.</p>
    <p>Playing his last game before retiring, Zinedine Zidane&#8217;s career ended in disgrace after he was sent off for
        crazily headbutting Marco Materazzi.</p>
    <p>Zidane had put France ahead early on with a coolly-taken chipped penalty, before Materazzi levelled with a header
        from an Andrea Pirlo corner.<br />
        The result caps an incredible period for Italian football, with the domestic game embroiled in a corruption
        scandal similar to 1982 when they last won the World Cup. &quot;</p>
