<p>Yes, I know, I&#8217;ve been slaking a little bit, and haven&#8217;t posted on my blog in a while. Well, I actually <em>didn&#8217;t</em> slack at all in these days getting ready to start my job, looking for a damn fitted kitchen for my house and&#8230; writing more articles.</p>
<p>Nothing special, and nothing too technical, to be honest, but equally interesting. First of all I updated my <a href="/articles/view/ie-lovers-guide-to-firefox/">An IE Lover&#8217;s Guide to Firefox</a> a little bit and people at SpreadFirefox.com and <a href="http://www.firefoxfacts.com/">FirefoxFacts</a> liked it. Glad to hear that, unfortunately some guy who wrote about <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/SupportCD/FirefoxMyths.html">Firefox Myths</a> wasn&#8217;t too impressed, but at any rate he read it anyway.</p>
<p>OK, this wasn&#8217;t a new article at all, but <a href="/articles/view/the-internet-philosopher/">this one</a> is fresh, at least. It&#8217;s about a Swedish guy who decided to emigrate to India pursuing an ideal: writing for his own opinions and ideas. And he gets paid for that too! After reading more about him on his <a href="/bookmarks/view/ropix">website</a> I decided to write something about him. An interesting and rather unusual read. Pity that some sections of his homepage are in Swedish only.</p>
<p>Finally, yesterday I felt inspired and decided to write <a href="/articles/view/social-bookmarking-services">another roundup</a> featuring ten popular social bookmarking websites. Trying all those services was fun, with a few exceptions of course. The bad news is that there are already various reviews about social bookmarking sites and thus the Digg folk doesn&#8217;t seem to be particularly interested in <a href="http://digg.com/software/Ten_popular_social_bookmarking_services_reviewed">reading another one</a>, but hey! After all I can&#8217;t expect of getting dugg for every roundup I write, can&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it. And what about the CakePHP article I promised <a href="/blog/view/13/">long ago</a> to CakePHP beginners? It&#8217;s done, written and ready to be published! Unfortunately the magazine I submitted it to is taking quite a bit to review it and &#8211; most important &#8211; to tell me whether they&#8217;ll publish it or not. Let&#8217;s hope for the best.</p>
