<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> just updated the <a href="/herald-vim-color-scheme/">Herald Vim color scheme</a> to improve the readability of delimiters and search results.</p>
<p>Delimiters are now red (the same color as operators) instead of yellow, so that you can tell the start and end of a string or regular expression more easily. Additionally, search results are no longer highlighted with black text on an orange background for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the orange background is a bit too strong</li>
	<li>the black foreground causes letters to become <em>completely hidden</em> by the <em>cursorline</em> and <em>cursorcolumn</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Search results now have a gray background and a yellow background, as shown in the screenshot on the right.</p>
<p>If you have any constructive suggestion on how to improve this color scheme, don&#8217;t hesitate to add a comment to this post!</p>
