<p>Part of my family house in the countryside is now available for rent! It's located in the small village of <a
        href="http://italia.indettaglio.it/eng/liguria/genova_bogliasco_sessarego.html">Sessarego</a>, a few minutes
    away from the coast, on the Italian Riviera.<br />
    We've been living there recently for 6 months when I started working and then moved to the city in order to be
    nearer to my workplace, but we still go there on holidays or on the odd week end, sometimes.</p>
<p>The house is fully furnished, it has been recently renovated, and offers all major comforts and services (utilities,
    TV, internet, phone, etc.). It can be ideal as a holiday house for writers, programmers, or anyone who would like to
    take a break from the chaotic city life without giving up all the commodities of modern life, such as the Internet.
