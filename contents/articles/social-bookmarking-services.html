<p>Social bookmarking<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is perhaps one of the pillars of Web
	2.0, allowing people to save, tag and share their Internet bookmarks online anytime, anywhere. Since
	<em>del.icio.us</em><sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> came out, the Web is not the same
	anymore: no more IE favourites or Firefox bookmarks, no more &#8220;Save page as&#8230;&#8221; etc., people nowadays
	want to do <em>everything</em> online without being bond to a single computer, and also make everything they do or
	read public &#8211; apparently. This is one of the key concepts of Web 2.0<sup class="footnote" id="fnr3"><a
			href="#fn3">3</a></sup>: sharing information in a quick and easy way, without any restrictions.Del.icio.us
	was the first, but of course not the only one social bookmarking system which became popular in a few months: many
	other followed its example, many companies developed their own alternative to del.icio.us, adding and removing
	features, changing bits etc. etc. Result: someone said that <em>&#8220;[&#8230;] There is almost 1 new social
		bookmark/digg like service appears one daily basis [&#8230;]&#8221;</em><sup class="footnote" id="fnr4"><a
			href="#fn4">4</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Nice, and there are also many reviews of each one as well<sup class="footnote" id="fnr5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>!
	Here's another one&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Preliminary Notes</strong>: This round-up does <em>not</em> include <em>all</em> social bookmarking sites
		and yes, there are a lot missing. I decided to pick 10 services out of the dozens available for one simple
		reason: make this article more readable. I'm really sorry if your favourite social bookmarking site is not
		listed: if you feel creative you can add your (short!) review as a comment to this article.<br />
		Although I recently wrote a very positive review of Ma.gnolia<sup class="footnote" id="fnr6"><a
				href="#fn6">6</a></sup> and I know its lead developer, I do <em>not</em> consider myself partial towards
		Ma.gnolia, you'll notice when I review it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Common features and concepts</h3>
<p>The social bookmarking sites reviewed in this article are: del.icio.us<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a
			href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, Ma.gnolia<sup class="footnote" id="fnr7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>, Furl<sup
		class="footnote" id="fnr8"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>, Spurl<sup class="footnote" id="fnr9"><a
			href="#fn9">9</a></sup>, Yahoo MyWeb 2.0<sup class="footnote" id="fnr10"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>
	Blinklist<sup class="footnote" id="fnr11"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup>, Smarking<sup class="footnote" id="fnr12"><a
			href="#fn12">12</a></sup>, Shadows<sup class="footnote" id="fnr13"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup>, Simpy<sup
		class="footnote" id="fnr14"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> and Blogmarks<sup class="footnote" id="fnr15"><a
			href="#fn15">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p>All these social bookmarking sites have some features in common which can be used to define <em>social
		bookmarking</em> itself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They allow users to save URLs online, adding some notes to it, and share them with others</li>
	<li>Each url can be <em>tagged</em> with custom tags user can create and manage</li>
	<li><span class="caps">RSS</span> is widely supported, so you can included your &#8220;recent bookmarks&#8221; in
		your blog, for example</li>
	<li>They allow users to import/export bookmarks in various formats</li>
	<li>They support the creation and management of user profiles</li>
	<li>Bookmarklet, buttons or other cute little things are provided to make your life easier and bookmark faster</li>
</ul>
Such features will not be mentioned over and over in each review, of course.
<h3>Review parameters</h3>
<p>Besides an overview for each service and some notes regarding their intended <em>audience</em>, some other parameters
	will be considered and rated from 0 to 10 (the higher, the better):</p>
<p><em>Speed</em><br />
	I'm currently on dialup, and so I'll be able to effectively test the speed and rendering time of each
	site. The higher the mark, the faster the site is.</p>
<p><em>Features</em><br />
	Notes concerning added/missing features, and overall features rating.</p>
<p><em>Simplicity</em><br />
	Do you need to be a certified geek&#8482; in order to use the service or even your dog can learn how to use it, if
	he tries hard?</p>
<p><em>Interface/Design</em><br />
	This parameter concerns the visual appearance of a website. Note: it can be particularly subjective, I'll try
	my best to be objective.</p>
<p><em>Userbase</em><br />
	Basically the amount of people which use a determined service.</p>

<h3><a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/delicious.gif" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 10 &#8211; This is by far the fastest site to load, perhaps because it doesn't
		have any fancy eye-candy at all</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 6 &#8211; del.icio.us offers only the most essential features, nothing too fancy, but
		nothing too bad either</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 6 &#8211; You need some time to get used to it, but it's not confusing like
		some others. Hardly any documentation or tutorial provided, but hey, this is the geek's choice after all
	</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 6 &#8211; Personally I like it, but I know I have no taste for design and
		interfaces. An average user would say that it's too plain and no, nothing fancy at all</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 10 &#8211; Judging by the amount of people coming to my site after one of my article
		made it to digg, compared to other social bookmarking services, this is BY <span class="caps">FAR</span> the
		most used one. Everyone has a del.icio.us account, then, maybe, something else</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 7.6</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	This is <span class="caps">THE</span> social bookmarking service, it is the first, the most supported (every other
	service allows importing from del.icio.us), and the most used, with several thousands of registered users.
	Obviously, this made it the main term of comparison for other bookmarking services, which claim to be
	<em>better</em> because they are successful exactly where del.icio.us is lacking, e.g.:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Eye candy</li>
	<li>they offer better user interaction (comments, messages)</li>
	<li>Ratings are supported</li>
	<li>More <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and effects</li>
	<li>Other sites cache bookmarks internally or may offer thumbnails</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, del.icio.us still remains the geek's choice, the numbers speak by themselves. It is also my
	choice at the moment, because of its simplicity (in the sense of &#8220;no useless things are included&#8221;) and
	speed.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> IT professionals, computer enthusiasts, tech-savvy people in general. Your old auntie
	probably won't like it, but at least she'll keep away from it and leave you in peace.</p>
<h3><a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">Ma.gnolia</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/magnolia.gif" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 5 &#8211; It's a bit slow if compared to competitors. Maybe it's just me,
		maybe it's the server, maybe it's Ruby on Rails.</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 7 &#8211; Saved copies, <span class="caps">AJAX</span> 5-star ratings, <span
			class="caps">AJAX</span> private/public lock, groups &amp; messages</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 8 &#8211; Fairly simple to learn and use, excellent documentation online</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 10 &#8211; I really like Ma.gnolia's website design over all the
		others: clean, simple and professional with <span class="caps">AJAX</span> features in the right place.</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 6 &#8211; It's fairly new so not many people are using it. It's being
		pushed by Zeldman &amp; ALA's crew though</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 7.2</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	This <em>was</em> my first choice and the first social bookmarking site I reviewed<sup class="footnote" id="fnr6"><a
			href="#fn6">6</a></sup> and tried properly. It is developed in Ruby on Rails and it excels in simplicity and
	visual appearance, but it has some rather annoying CONs. First of all it's a bit slow for my liking,
	especially now that I'm on dialup. Second, the search is currently limited to tags only: it's obviously
	a temporary thing and it will be back soon though, but I gave it a 7 instead of a 8 for features for this
	reason.<br />
	Ads are visible on the top of every page &#8211; subscribe (soon) to remove them&#8230; oh well.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Anyone, although it seems to be the choice of <em>web designers</em> and people
	involved in website development.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.furl.net/">Furl</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/furl.gif" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 7 &#8211; Fast enough, no complains and no unnecessary objects or images either.</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 6 &#8211; saved copies, plenty of tools including their own toolbar, multiple
		categories but no tagclouds and not as customizeable as the others</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 7 &#8211; Simple, organized, essential. Documentation available.</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 5 &#8211; This is nothing fancy at all compared to the others, a fairly
		<em>traditional</em> web interface. <em>Web 2.0?</em> &#8230;Pardon?
	</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 8 &#8211; This is one of the oldest social bookmarking services and it's easier
		than del.icio.us, that's why the fairly large userbase.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 6.6</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	When I tried this service after trying the others I wasn't impressed at all. The interface is fairly standard,
	all done in a traditional way, no <span class="caps">AJAX</span> at all: if you absolutely hate Web 2.0 hype, even
	when it's actually useful, go for this. To rate a bookmark I must click on edit and select the rating from a
	select menu: our children wouldn't believe it.<br />
	The good thing about Furl, and what made it popular, presumably, is its simplicity over other similar services like
	del.icio.us, that's the most logical reason I could find to explain its popularity.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Anyone, users against or not yet accustomed to Web 2.0 interactivity</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.spurl.net/">Spurl</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/spurl.jpg" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 8 &#8211; Fast and pleasant to look at, no complaints</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 7 &#8211; Saved copies, del.icio.us sync, useful stats, no ratings, multilingual,
		some quirks (see below)</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 8 &#8211; Yes, this is really simple and straightforward to use. Extensive
		documentation available.</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 8 &#8211; A really clean, simple, but yet nice looking and organized
		interface.</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 6 &#8211; Fairly popular, not as popular as del.icio.us but on the right track</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 7.4</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	Now this is is an interesting service. The first thing that I really liked about it is the good del.icio.us
	integration: not excellent because it seems to take quite a bit to import my del.icio.us bookmarks, but everything
	you bookmark with Spurl can be send to del.icio.us at the same time and vice versa! They also offer interesting
	stats regarding your bookmarks, report broken links, cache webpages, etc. <br />
	Some annoying things must be noted though (hence the 7 in features): the bookmarklet will popup a window &#8211; not
	great; it doesn't support ratings and the tag management could be improved: del.icio.us and ma.gnolia can
	<em>suggest</em> tags when saving a bookmarks, while Spurl unfortunately doesn't. It also seems to be less
	tag-centric than the others (except for Furl of course). It is multi-language and offers a 18+ filter &#8211; but if
	you forget to mark a bookmark as &#8220;explicit&#8221; it won't work, and as result you can get porn links on
	the homepage&#8230;
</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> Anyone, del.icio.us users who would like to try something new without losing sync with
	their favourite service.</p>
<h3><a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo MyWeb 2.0</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/myweb2.0.jpg" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 6 &#8211; Not too fast, like other sites in the Yahoo network.</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 5 &#8211; &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;? Well, yes, it has tag clouds and allows bookmark
		sharing, but that's about it.</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 7 &#8211; Integrated with Yahoo services (and toolbar), fairly easy to use, if you
		don't know something the FAQs are handy.</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 6 &#8211; Clean, simple and a bit boring &#8211; perhaps I'm just to
		used to the rest of the sites in the Yahoo network</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 8 &#8211; Grab some random users and a big chunk of Yahoo enthusiasts: not bad!</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 6.4</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	When I first read about it, I though: <em>look, Yahoo is ready to embrace the Web 2.0 philosophy</em>, then I tried
	it and changed my mind: it has tags, tag clouds, it allows sharing but nothing more than that. The interface is
	still Web 1.0, and <span class="caps">AJAX</span> methodologies are not used at all. <br />
	Basically this service grasps the basic concepts from del.icio.us &amp; C., simplifies them and re-presents them in
	a form which can be easily understood by the majority of Internet users of the planet (and primarly Yahoo users) and
	<em>yet</em> look innovative. Excellent marketing work, perhaps, but nothing too new or particularly useful there.
</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for</strong>: Anyone, in particular Yahoo users for the excellent integration with the rest of Yahoo
	services.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.blinklist.com/">Blinklist</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/blinklist.gif" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 7 &#8211; Fast, especially considering the type of interface</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 10 &#8211; The service which offers more features than anyone else, simply that.
		Ratings, quit bookmarks, video tutorials, <span class="caps">AJAX</span> where needed, tabs, starred links,
		message board etc. etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 7 &#8211; Considering the amount of features it offers, it's simple enough to
		use. Impressive Help section.</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 9 &#8211; I really like its interface, the scary amount of <span
			class="caps">AJAX</span> code it uses et al. Not a 10 because the five icons at the top (Gnome-like?)
		don't go well with the rest of the design, only that.</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 7 &#8211; Not too popular, and new to the scene</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 8</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	This should technically be the winner. These guys truly did their best trying to build perhaps the most &#8220;Web
	2.0 compliant&#8221; social bookmarking service ever. The downside of it is just the huge amount of <span
		class="caps">AJAX</span> involved in all this, but if you're fine with that, Blinklist is truly amazing.
	It uses a digg-like approach to <em>blink</em> the urls which appear on the site instantly: an <span
		class="caps">AJAX</span> div fades in allowing you to fill in the bookmark's details and then it fades
	away incrementing the <em>blink</em> count and adding it to your collection. The private area has a quadri-tabbed
	sidebar with: 1) real-time chat, 2) popular tags view, 3) recent tags used, 4) cloud view. It supports site
	thumbnails but not saved copies unfortunately, advanced profiles, avatars, ratings&#8230; <br />
	Advanced, &#8220;cool&#8221; and (perhaps too much) on the edge. In Italian we have a word for things like this, but
	I won't mention it here. Just think about <em>Fast and Furious</em>, the feeling when browsing this site can
	be similar to driving an heavily modded car: if you like the way it works, it's the best thing ever &#8211; if
	not, well, del.icio.us does the job alright.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for</strong>: Web 2.0 lovers, geeks, anyone brave enough to try it without getting too shocked</p>
<h3><a href="http://smarking.com/">Smarking</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/smarking.jpg" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 7 &#8211; Nothing superfluous in the interface, but it could be faster</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 8 &#8211; Proper messaging, advanced profiles, <span class="caps">STATS</span>!</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 7 &#8211; Easy to learn and use, has a <span class="caps">FAQ</span> and a wiki
	</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 7 &#8211; Very traditional but functional interface. Not too fancy or
		advanced, but does the job</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 4 &#8211; About 300 users</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 6.8</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	Don't expect anything too fancy from Smarking, but a few features caught my attention. For one, it supports a
	proper messaging system: other services allow you to send notes and a link to other users, while this one has a
	proper, built-in private messaging system&#8230; OK, not a big thing but nice to have. The design is not too great:
	it does the job but there's hardly any image, nevermind <span class="caps">AJAX</span> effects or
	similar.<br />
	What really impressed me (hence the 8 in features), are the detailed stats that this service makes available
	publicly: detailed domain stats, tag stats, user stats and more while others simply don't bother.<br />
	It was developed using Python and PostgreSQL by an Italian student of Computer Science &#8211; apparently
	there's someone who is able to program properly in my country as well. Good job: nothing too exceptional as
	social bookmarking service, but an exemplary work.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for</strong>: Italians in particular and everybody else as well.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.shadows.com/">Shadows</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/shadows.gif" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 5 &#8211; I don't know if it's because of Rails or the interface, but this
		site doesn's seem to perform as well as the others</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 7 &#8211; enhanced commenting, saved copies, thumbnails, groups</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 6 &#8211; The usual FAQs are there, but other than that there's no particular
		effort to make newbie's life easier</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 5 &#8211; Simple but not quite pretty interface, no graphic effor whatsoever,
		<span class="caps">AJAX</span> for adding and editing comments
	</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 6 &#8211; Not a tiny userbase but not huge either</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 6</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	Maybe it's just me, but I wasn't too impressed by Shadows: it doesn't offer any particular
	innovative feature other than enhanced commenting. You can start real discussions about your bookmarks and interact
	with other users fairly well, but the question is: do you really want to? Perhaps an interesting way to build
	communities, but other than that nothing special. <br />
	The interface is not too pretty, unlike Ma.gnolia it looks like they didn't make a terrible effort trying to
	design something pleasant to look at and the final result is quite boring. They seem to support thumbnails, but
	clearly they use a third party service like Alexa because there's hardly any thumbnail displayed, generally:
	wrong choice &#8211; see Blogmarks below for a better thumbnail support.<br />
	And yes, the default green smily default avatar is terribly cheesy and truly annoying (not that the others are any
	better&#8230;).</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for</strong>: Anybody? Nobody? Maybe people who like a more community-like approach</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.simpy.com/">Simpy</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/simpy.png" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 7 &#8211; It's fast, but again, its interface is not anything fancy</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 7 &#8211; Detects broken links and redirections, notes, groups</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 6 &#8211; It has FAQs but it could look confusing for inexperienced users</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 6 &#8211; Nothing special, no eye candy, no <span class="caps">AJAX</span>
		even where it would be appreciated</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 7 &#8211; Medium-sized userbase</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 6.6</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	The best feature offered by Simpy is the link detection service, able to detect broken links, duplicates and
	redirections. Everything else looks pretty normal and nothing special: it offers tag management, groups, notes, the
	usual tools. Copies of your bookmarks are <span class="caps">NOT</span> cached, and clicking on the <em>cached</em>
	link will take you to web.archive.org, hoping that it cached the page you're looking for (hell even I could do
	that!).<br />
	No <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, nothing too pretty. Boring? Well, no, let's call it functional and
	essential.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for</strong>: Anybody, moderate experience required</p>
<h3><a href="http://blogmarks.net">Blogmarks</a><br />
	<img src="/images/pictures/socbook/blogmarks.jpg" alt="" />
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 5 &#8211; It's slow. One of the main reasons ought to be the thumbnails: every
		bookmark has an associated image!</li>
	<li><strong>Features:</strong> 7 &#8211; Excellent thumbnail support, Private tags, usual things</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> 6 &#8211; It's pretty straightforward, but there's only one page to
		help new users</li>
	<li><strong>Interface/Design:</strong> 7 &#8211; Simple and essential, no <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, not too
		fancy</li>
	<li><strong>Userbase:</strong> 7 &#8211; One year old, medium userbase</li>
	<li><em><strong>Overall Rating: 6.4</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
	Again, nothing too special &#8211; except, of course, that <em>all</em> bookmarks have a thumbnail: a good thing
	which made me feel popular for about 0.7 seconds when I noticed a little picture showing my own site when someone
	bookmarked it, but on the other hand quite annoying and pointless for dialup users.<br />
	No Web 2.0 interface, just plain old stuff which does the job but is not particularly pleasant or innovative.
	Private tags? A good thing maybe, and probably the only real innovation compared to other similar services.</p>
<p><strong>Suitable for</strong>: Anybody, moderate experience required</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Although del.icio.us is still the leading service for social bookmarking, its competitors are obviously getting
	better. Among the ones I reviewed today, at least some of them look promising: Blinklist is definitely the most
	advanced in terms of features offered and technology used, and I think I'll try it out a bit more and see if
	it can be better than del.icio.us in the long run. Spurls is also tempting especially because it offers various
	interesting features without <em>forcing</em> you to abandon your del.icio.us account &#8211; and that was an
	excellent (and wise) feature Spurl developers chose to implement, without any doubt. Regarding my old favourite,
	Ma.gnolia, it still deserves a mention, mainly for being a succesful blend of latest technology and class design,
	without being too extreme.</p>
<p>So&#8230; what's <em>your</em> favorite then?</p>
