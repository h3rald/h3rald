<p>When I first tried Ruby on Rails I was literally amazed by the <em>generator</em> script. Yes, I was young and
	inexperienced then (six/seven months ago), but you must admit that getting a controller, a model, all the basic
	views generated automatically by</p>
<p><code>rails script/generator scaffold Posts</code></p>
<p>is not a bad thing. Especially if the same script allows you to create model, views and controller separately and
	other things. <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">Symfony</a> and <span class="caps">PHP</span> on Trax
	already tried to port this functionalities, with mixed results. What about Cake? Oh well, yes, we do have something
	like that&#8230; something rather different, but still something: the <code>bake.php</code> script.<br />
	This cute little thing is located in the <code>cake/scripts/</code> folder and can be used &#8211; hear, hear
	&#8211; from command line. You can run Ruby and Perl scripts, so yes, you can actually run <span
		class="caps">PHP</span> from command line, although it's not its primary purpose.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pictures/bake.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Cool then, let's open a *nix shell, Windows command prompt, etc. etc., go into the <code>cake/scripts/</code>
	folder and run:</p>
<p><code>php bake.php</code></p>
<p>Assuming that the php executable is in your <em><span class="caps">PATH</span></em> environment variable &#8211; if
	not, either you add it or you'll have to type something like:</p>
<p><code>D:SERVERphpphp.exe bake.php</code></p>
<p>depending on where your php executable is. You'll be be greeted by a &#8220;<span class="caps">CAKEPHP</span>
	<span class="caps">BAKE</span>&#8221; text, and then you'll be asked a few questions. One thing to realize
	before proceeding any further: bake.php is <em>not</em> a generator, not in the traditional &#8220;Rails&#8221;
	sense, anyway. It's rather a handy but more verbose dialogue-based configuration script &#8211; which will
	also generate <em>something</em> eventually if you provide all the necessary details.<br />
	A different approach, which may be good or bad according to your taste: personally I think we should also have
	something faster to use, like a Rails generator, and I opened a <a
		href="https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/768">ticket</a> about it, but let's see what bake.php can do, for
	now.
</p>
<p>The answer is&#8230; nearly anything. It annoying enough to please, but if you follow its directions it can do a
	prettu decent job in the end, it's far from being sentient, but let's say it's smart enough for a
	script. First of all if you try it out on a fresh Cake install it will notice that you haven't configured your
	database yet, so it will ask for a hostname, username, password, database name etc. etc. and generate your
	<code>app/config/database.php</code> for you, not a bad start.
</p>
<p>Once that's done &#8211; and it won't go on unless you configure a (MySQL only?) database &#8211; you can
	proceed with the rest. You can start creating either a controller, model or view; I tried a <code>Posts</code>
	controller, for example. The script then asks quite a few questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The controller's name</li>
	<li>Whether it will use other models besides posts</li>
	<li>Whether you want to include any helper</li>
	<li>Whether you want to include any component</li>
	<li>Whether you want to generate the base <span class="caps">CRUD</span> methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Then finally it generates the damn thing. The result is good enough:</p>
<p><small><br />
		<pre><code>
&lt;?php
class PostsController extends AppController
{
	//var $scaffold;
	var $name       = 'Posts';</p>
<p>function index()<br />
	{<br />
		$this&#8594;set(&#8216;data', $this&#8594;Post&#8594;findAll());<br />
	}</p>
<p>function add()<br />
	{<br />
		if(empty($this&#8594;params[&#8216;data']))<br />
		{<br />
			$this&#8594;render();<br />
		}<br />
		else<br />
		{<br />
			if($this&#8594;Post&#8594;save($this&#8594;params[&#8216;data']))<br />
			{<br />
				$this&#8594;flash(&#8216;Post saved.', &#8216;/posts/index');<br />
			}<br />
			else<br />
			{<br />
				$this&#8594;render();<br />
			}<br />
		}<br />
	}</p>
<p>function edit($id)<br />
	{<br />
		if(empty($this&#8594;params[&#8216;data']))<br />
		{<br />
			$this&#8594;set(&#8216;data', $this&#8594;Post&#8594;find(&#8216;Post.id = ' . $id));<br />
		}<br />
		else<br />
		{<br />
			if($this&#8594;Post&#8594;save($this&#8594;params['data']))<br />
			{<br />
				$this&#8594;flash(&#8216;Post saved.', &#8216;/posts/index');<br />
			}<br />
			else<br />
			{<br />
				$this&#8594;set(&#8216;data', $this&#8594;params[&#8216;data']);<br />
				$this&#8594;validateErrors($this&#8594;Post);<br />
				$this&#8594;render();<br />
			}<br />
		}<br />
	}</p>
<p>function view($id)<br />
	{<br />
		$this&#8594;set(&#8216;data', $this&#8594;Post&#8594;find('Post.id = ' . $id));<br />
	}</p>
<p>function delete($id)<br />
	{<br />
		$this&#8594;Post&#8594;del($id);<br />
		$this&#8594;redirect(&#8216;/posts/index');<br />
	}</p>
<p>function postList()<br />
	{<br />
		$vars = $this&#8594;Post&#8594;findAll();<br />
		foreach($vars as $var)<br />
		{<br />
			$list[$var[&#8216;Post'][&#8216;id']] = $var[&#8216;Post'][&#8216;name'];<br />
		}</p>
<p>return $list;<br />
	}<br />
}<br />
?&gt;<br />
</code></pre><br />
	</small></p>
<p>It's more or less the same with models and views: it will still ask a lot of questions and in the end generate
	the thing. <br />
	This behaviour is more advanced than a standard generator, you can include helpers and components already, if you
	want, but do you <em>really</em> want that? For models it even asks if you want to include particular associations
	and validation rules! Personally, I'd rather a generator script which generates something <em>immediately</em>
	and accepts maybe some parameters to further customization, like:</p>
<p><code>php bake.php scaffold Posts</code><br />
	<code>php bake.php controller Posts</code><br />
	<code>php bake.php model Posts</code><br />
	<code>php bake.php model Posts</code><br />
	<code>php bake.php controller Posts helper +Html -Time,Javascript</code><br />
	<code>php bake.php model Posts assoc +hasMany comments,tags</code>
</p>
<p>Bah&#8230; just some random thoughts. How about custom-made generators (<a
		href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/AvailableGenerators">Rails-inspired</a>)?</p>
