<p>As <a href="http://digg.com/programming/CakePHP_1.0_has_been_released">Digg</a>_ points out, the first
    <em>stable</em> version of CakePHP was released, yesterday. I should have posted yesterday about it, and no, I
    didn&#8217;t forget: I was just busy downloading the new version, have a look at the new site, talk to people etc.
</p>
<p>Anyhow, it&#8217;s ready, just baked and smells damn good. Go get it if you didn&#8217;t already, it&#8217;s
    available at <a href="http://cakeforge.org/frs/?group_id=23">the usual place</a>, even this time you won&#8217;t be
    disappointed. CakePHP now reached the 1.0 milestone, in a way which reminds me a lot about Mozilla Firefox: a lot of
    people were already using it <em>before</em> it went stable officially!</p>

<p>The CakePHP Team has been humble enough not to declare their product <em>stable</em> before the time. I personally
    considered CakePHP stable <em>enough</em> since RC2&#8230; and considering that this site and many others have been
    built on alpha, beta and RC version, I think people can get an idea of Cake&#8217;s reliability.<br />
    Nothing (too) new came out the oven this time: CakePHP 1.0 is mainly a bugfix release, with all the features
    we&#8217;ve learnt to love. It&#8217;s just <em>better_: a lot of things have been fixed, model associations work
        better, etc. etc. You can read the <a
            href="http://cakeforge.org/frs/shownotes.php?group_id=23&amp;release">changelog/announcement</a></em>id=85
    or have a look below for a quick summary of the new features and most interesting fixes:</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not too excited about this new release, maybe you should have a look at <a
        href="http://www.cakephp.org">www.cakephp.org</a>. Different? Damn right it is: it looks like someone listened
    to our prayers for a new website design. The merciful soul is <a href="http://www.nolimit-studio.com/">Armando
        Sosa</a>, the winner of CakePHP&#8217;s design contest. He&#8217;s a latin-american web designer who had the
    <span class="caps">GREAT</span> idea of thinking about an <em>innovative</em> design for the Cake site&#8230;
    Actually my dad didn&#8217;t think that way: <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s not new, that way of advertising was all over
        the place when I was a kid!&#8221;</em> And he&#8217;s right, Armando thought that a fifties-like template would
    have been perfect for Cake. Forget all the smooth, roundy-and-chubby, toons-like &#8220;official&#8221; Web 2.0
    designs (beta), the new Cake site needs to stand out of the crowd&#8230;
