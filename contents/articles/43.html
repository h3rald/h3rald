<p>My fianc&eacute;e keeps telling me that too many cakes are not good for me, and I never listen: I always liked cakes! I <strong>did</strong> like the CakePHP&#8482;<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> framework too, once, and I <strong>did</strong> write <a href="http://www.h3rald.com/projects/view/cakephp-herald">some articles</a> about it in the past, and I believe at least a bunch of Bakers found them useful, especially at the time.<br />
I do believe the Cake&#8482; Software Foundation<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> quite liked having their framework featured on popular websites like php|architect and SitePoint, and I believe that I contributed &#8211; to some extent &#8211; to make it one of the most popular frameworks available for the <span class="caps">PHP</span> programming language.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though someone decided that two of such articles and my personal website were no longer worth a mention on CakePHP official website frontpage. To me, this makes sense since the two CakePHP-related series which are being published by <span class="caps">IBM</span> are much more up-to-date than my articles, and thus deserve such a mention instead.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I took a screenshot of the CakePHP website just yesterday <em>&#8220;by chance&#8221;</em> and my articles were still there:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.h3rald.com/img/pictures/cake-promo/cakephp-08032007.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>&#8230;while this morning they weren&#8217;t anymore:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.h3rald.com/img/pictures/cake-promo/cakephp-09032007.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course I can&#8217;t provide any proof that I took the screenshot yesterday, and of course I don&#8217;t have any proof of the fact that someone in <span class="caps">CSF</span> may have thought that due to my recent <a href="http://www.h3rald.com/blog/view/42/">bad behavior</a> my articles didn&#8217;t deserve to be publicized anymore. I am confident that the Cake Software Foundation always does its best in keeping its site up-to-date, and I am glad that yesterday&#8217;s accident reminded them that there were far better articles which needed to be featured on their site. At least I <em>finally</em> did something good for the community!</p>
<p>Sarcasm apart, I feel I owe an apology for blowing this whole thing out of proportions: I disclosed embarassing details about our past project which &#8211; for the sake of the framework &#8211; should have never been made public, perhaps.<br />
I want all of you to know that I still think that CakePHP is the best <span class="caps">PHP</span> framework ever made and I genuinely think that Larry E. Master did outstanding work in all this time, along with the rest of <span class="caps">CSF</span> members and contributors. Best of luck for your future editorial and development projects.</p>
<p>Since now my contributions are no longer &#8220;officially recognized&#8221;, I think I&#8217;d better to move on devoting my attention to something else.</p>
