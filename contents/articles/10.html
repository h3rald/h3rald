<p>Another five years have passed and here we go again: General Elections time!<br />
Today and tomorrow Italy <del>must</del> should vote for a new government, and the choice is <em>again</em> between two main contenders to the Prime Minister&#8217;s <del>throne</del> chair:</p>
<p>- <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/299254.stm">Romano Prodi</a><br />
- <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3034600.stm">Silvio Berlusconi</a></p>
<p>Just today I was reading an interesting article titled <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,409538,00.html"><em>&#8216;The End of Silvio&#8217;s Show?&#8217;</em></a> in which the author examines the possibility that Berlusconi&#8217;s five years of subtle pseudo-dictatorship may end in favour the former president of European Commission Romano Prodi.</p>
<p><em>Who are they?</em></p>
<p><strong>Silvio Berlusconi</strong><br />

<p>I can&#8217;t imagine someone asking this question, at least I can&#8217;t think of anyone who doesn&#8217;t know Silvio Berlusconi as the icon of the latest <em>national oddity</em>. <br />
Forthose who need their memory refreshed, here&#8217;s a small collection of links featuring him:</p>

<p>There are millions more. In particular, I&#8217;d like to add one more: <a href="http://www.consapevolezza.it/notizie/gen-mar-2002/impero_berlusconi.asp">The Empire of Silvio Berlusconi</a>, which features an image taken from an Italian magazine listing (roughly) everything owned (the image is dated 2002) by our current (for now) Prime Minister, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mediaset Television (100%) &#8211; which includes three national channels</li>
	<li>Medusa Film (100%) &#8211; Movie productions</li>
	<li>Milan A.C. (99%) &#8211; Football team</li>
	<li>Edilnord (63%) &#8211; Real Estate</li>
	<li>Blockbuster (51%) &#8211; Video retal shops</li>
	<li>Mondadori Spa (48%) &#8211; Biggest Italian editorial company</li>
	<li>Mediolanum (35.5%) &#8211; Financial sociaty &#8211; banks, insurances etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice, isn&#8217;t it? Of course he had to give those societies to some trusted administrators before becoming Prime Minister&#8230; but let&#8217;s not talk about this&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Romano Prodi</strong><br />

<p>Perhaps not as well known abroad as Silvio, but was recently the President of the European Commission for a while. Here are some (more serious) links about him:</p>

<p>Known as &#8220;The Professor&#8221; for his education&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&#8220;He graduated in economics at Milan&#8217;s Catholic University in 1961 and did postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics. He also spent a year as visiting professor at Harvard in 1974&#8221;</em><br />

<p>&#8230;Romano Prodi is the candidate proposed by the current Italian opposition, grouping roughly all the center-left parties. He&#8217;s the one who pushed Italy &#8211; as President of the European Commission &#8211; to accept the Euro as new currency, back in the day, and also the one who was blamed for than after a few months when the <em>Euro effect</em> occurred: prices went higher and didn&#8217;t seem to be an <em>exact conversion</em> from Lire to Euro. He was chubby enough (&#8220;mortadella&#8221; is one of his most recurring nicknames) to be quickly appointed as scapegoat for the unpleasant situation.</p>

<p>Besides that, if someone asks me what&#8217;s the difference between the two candidates, I&#8217;ll answer: one is a politician and devoted all his life to Politics, while the other partly devoted only the last 10-years-or-so to politics because it seemed to be <em>a cool and worthwhile investment</em>&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>Who am going to vote?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, one thing is sure: I don&#8217;t want Silvio to win again, I don&#8217;t want Italy to be publicly ridicolized abroad all the time that muppet opens his mouth or simply does something <em>he</em> thinks is funny&#8230;</p>
