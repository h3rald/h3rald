	<p>Learning a programming language can be hard and time consuming. You normally have to go through a bunch of
		tutorials, ask questions, read books&#8230; Ruby is no exception: there are plenty of resources out there about
		it, but it is often hard to find what you&#8217;re looking for. So, as a weekend project, I decided to create a
		<em>Ruby Compendium</em>, a short book about the Ruby Ecosystem.</p>
	<p>I guarantee that you <em>will not</em> be able to code in Ruby after reading this book. Yes, you read it right,
		this book is not about coding, it&#8217;s about learning what&#8217;s out there for you that can help you to
		learn how to program in Ruby. Information on Ruby implementations, versions, web sites, books, podcasts, a
		handful of Ruby gems to solve common problems&#8230; it&#8217;s all in there.</p>

	<p>The <em>Ruby Compendium</em> is available free of charge, under the terms of the <a
