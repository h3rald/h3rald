<p>When the SitePoint staff asked me to write an article summing up all the new features of Firefox 3, I gladly
    accepted: I wrote about Firefox before, and I thought it was just going to be a 2-3 hours job maximum. <br />
    After diving deeper into Firefox 3 development, reading dozens of different blogs and scouting Mozilla's web
    sites, I realized I was wrong: Firefox 3 introduced <em>a lot</em> of new things, and keeping track of all of them,
    I admit, was quite a hard task.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wrote the article and delivered it to SitePoint in time fore the release, but my editor
    &#8220;complained&#8221; that 8,300+ words was about 3 times over the minimum requirements for a feature article!
    <br />
    <em>&#8220;I don't really think that people can read the whole thing online&#8221;</em> &mdash;, he said, and
    I somehow agreed.
</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to pack my &#8220;article&#8221; into a 30-pages <span class="caps">PDF</span> eBook which
    can be downloaded <em>absolutely free of charge</em> from SitePoint web site as well, so here it is:</p>

    <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> <strong><a href="http://firefox.s3.sitepoint.com/ff3-revealed.zip">Firefox 3
                Revealed</a></strong> </span>
</p>
<p>If you prefer though, you can still read the article directly on SitePoint, <a
        href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/firefox-3-whats-new-whats-hot">here</a>.</p>
<p>This guide aims to give you a comprehensive overview of virtually <em>all</em> the new features and improvements
    introduced by Firefox 3.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the whole SitePoint staff for giving me the opportunity to write this eBook, and in particular
    <strong><a href="http://magain.com/blog/">Matthew Magain</a></strong> for his help and support (and for creating the
    <span class="caps">PDF</span> on a Sunday evening!).<br />
    Additionally, I would also like to thank the Mozilla Development Team for their awesome job with Firefox 3 and
    everyone else who made this eBook possible.
