<p>Gustavo Carreno just <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/4e13231cc383b9bb/6414184c1058fadb#6414184c1058fadb">announced</a> a new release of the <a href="http://cakeforge.org/frs/?group_id=53&amp;release_id=82">CakePHP Offline Manual</a>. Personally I was extremely happy to download this new release because it finally contains documentation and howtos related to CakePHP&#8217;s Model Associations, which is perhaps one of the most used <em>advanced</em> CakePHP features.<br />
So I&#8217;ll have no excuses not to learn how to use them, great&#8230;</p>
<p>The manual is available in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Windows compressed <span class="caps">HTML</span> (.chm)</li>
	<li><span class="caps">PDF</span></li>
	<li><span class="caps">HTML</span> (multiple pages or single page)</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the CakePHP <span class="caps">API</span> is also available for download in .chm format, thanks to  Mladen Mihajlovic.</p>
<p>Well done guys. Really useful for people like me who are on dialup sometimes :)</p>
