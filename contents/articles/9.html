<p>Today I had my <em>n^th^</em>  job interview. Yes, I&#8217;m getting used to them by now, and it&#8217;s becoming quite entertaining: if they <em>paid</em> me for just take interviews I&#8217;d do that for all my life quite happily! <br />
But since that&#8217;s not going to happen I&#8217;d better get a move on and find a so called <em>real job</em>. Actually this time it wasn&#8217;t the usual complete waste of time and this company <em>nearly</em> made me a proper offer: they&#8217;re gonna see me again next week, so let&#8217;s hope for the best.</p>
<p>The interview was one of the best ever, no doubts. They were friendly enough, they seemed to like me enough and they were even entertaining enough&#8230; one thing which actually <em>never</em> happened to me before: they asked me to solve a sort of pseudo-IQ-test(an annoying semi-pointless riddle, in other words), and here&#8217;s a rough translation from Italian, the comments within square brackets are mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You&#8217;re alone in a pitch black room [&#8230;nice intro, eh?] and the only thing you have are two fuses of different length and a lighter [thank God for that, now it&#8217;s all much better]. You know that both the fuses can burn in exactly one hour each, although there&#8217;s no proportional law which bonds the lenght of the fuses to the time necessary to burn them; how can you measure 45 minutes, exactly?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I solved that, eventually, and I got the job! Weheee!</p>
<p>No, more or less, but not quite&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna see them again, and evaluate their offer along with the other(s).</p>
<p>The solution of the riddle? NO <span class="caps">CHANCE</span>! Go and figure it out, it&#8217;s not hard.</p>
