<p>I&#8217;m back. I was so eager to go on holiday that I didn&#8217;t even bother writing a post about it, too bad. I
    actually when on holiday for a week but I thought I&#8217;d take three weeks off from my blog duties in favor of
    laziness and relax, but unfortunately my laptop decided to go wrong as well, so I didn&#8217;t actually manage to
    relax that much.</p>
<p>Now everything is fine. I still have to send in my laptop for assistance but it&#8217;s usable at least, and I
    finally found the time (and the money) to buy a desktop PC. I always wanted to build my own, actually, but in the
    end I decided to opt for a pre-made Fujitsu Siemens, mainly for economic reasons and time constraints. I won&#8217;t
    publish the specs, but it&#8217;s alright for me and my fianc&eacute;e.</p>
<p>So what now? Well&#8230; the usual: more posts will soon be added to the Simply On Rails series, a Ruby-related
    article is on the way (it will be edited by the excellent <a href="http://www.cyberarmy.net">CyberArmy</a>
    Publication Editing Staff this time), I may venture in a site upgrade whenever they decide to release version 4.2 of
    Typo which is supposed to be imminent and I&#8217;ll eventually complete another pet project of mine, but that will
    take more time&#8230;</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
