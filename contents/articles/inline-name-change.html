<p>I've been kindly asked by the lead developer of <a
		href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/">RubyInLine</a> to change the name of my <a
		href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/inline/">InLine</a> project, due to potential confusion and conflicts.</p>
<p>This makes sense, and I'm ready to change the name of my project, although I'm not that good at choosing original and
	<em>smart</em> names, so well, any suggestion is more than welcome!</p>
<p>I was thinking of something like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>RawLine</li>
	<li>EditLine</li>
	<li>RawInput</li>
	<li>RubyInput</li>
	<li>RubyLine</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally think that <strong>RawLine</strong> is probably the best option, but please, if have any better idea
	just speak up!</p>
<p>P.S.: &#8220;RedLine&#8221; is taken, unfortunately, otherwise it would have been my first choice since the
	beginning.</p>
