<p>I've been neglecting my blog, I know. The truth is that I'm quite busy in this period: I have more responsibilities
	in my daily full-time jobs, my lunch breaks are getting shorter and I don't have much free time. At any rate, here's
	what's going on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I'm writing a new article for an online magazine (assuming I'm gonna finish it)</li>
	<li>I signed up for a freelance technical reviewing job, for a new Ruby book which will come out soon-ish</li>
	<li>I'm getting ready to finally visit Rome (again), this time with my fianc√©e, for our fifth anniversary.</li>
	<li>I'm slowly preparing a version 1.0 of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redbook/">RedBook</a>, which involves
		quite a lot of refactoring (and hopefully better documentation and tests).</li>
	<li>I'm trying to learn a little bit of Haskell: it seems to be one of the few non .<span class="caps">NET</span>
		languages able to produce standalone .exe files, nowadays&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, I now decided to use <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> regularly, so you can follow me <a
		href="http://twitter.com/h3rald/">there</a>, if you wish!</p>
