<p>Tutorials are great, articles are helpful, manuals are essential and the <span class="caps">API</span> is your best
	friend, but there's still something missing there&#8230; Unfortunately podcasts are not yet available, but the
	CakePHP team is proud to announce the creation of two <a href="http://cakephp.org/pages/screencasts">screencasts</a>
	in an effort to help new bakers familiarizing with CakePHP's concepts. <br />
	This is old news now, the screencasts section came together with the <a href="/articles/24">site overhaul</a> but I
	only got a chance to take a look at them (one of them only, to be totally honest) recently, and so here's a
	spoil&#8230; erhm, a <em>detailed</em> description of John Anderson's screencast about the <a
		href="http://manual.cakephp.org/chapter/18">Blog Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p style="float:left;"><img src="/images/pictures/CakePHP_1.0.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There's something I'll never do: a screencast. Recording every mouse movement, every word or piece of
	code typed in half an hour? No way! And what happens if I mistype something? People will keep pointing out the fact
	that I was starting to type <code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code> to close a <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tag, or that I waited an
	eternity like five full seconds before deciding what to do. I guess I'm quite paranoid&#8230; John did it, and
	he did it well. Using just bash, vim and Safari he was able to record an excellent 30-minutes screencast featuring
	the blog tutorial. <br />
	Before people start complaining that the blog tutorial should be completed in fifteen minutes, keep in mind that
	John's screencast is meant to show everything clearly to new users, via a trial and error approach if
	necessary.</p>
<p>Here's what happens in the screencast, nothing new if your read the blog tutorial, but still interesting,
	especially if you're new to Cake. Unfortunately there's no audio, but the video talks by itself and John
	will occasionally write some comments here and there.</p>
