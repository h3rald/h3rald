<p>Barack Obama may visit Columbus' birthplace on October 12th 2008, and take part in the city's celebration of the
    discovery of America, which is held in the city every year. As reported by <strong>Il Secolo <span
            class="caps">XIX</span></strong>, Genova's local newspaper.</p>
<p>Although the invitation has not been officially accepted by the American Presidential Candidate, Genoa's mayor
    <strong>Marta Vincenzi</strong> is working very hard to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Kerry Kennedy</strong> (Bob Kennedy's daughter), is said to be in charge of liaising with Obama on the US
    side.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;[&#8230;] Kerry Kennedy and her family &ndash; among the first and most unexpected of Obama's supporters
        in his challange against Hillary Clinton &ndash; are said to be organising his visit to Genoa. It all started
        when Kerry came to the city at the beginning of July, for the Week of Human Rights initiative promoted by the
        city's council. Kerry was introduced to Nando Dalla Chiesa's &#8216;Columbus Day' program plan by Vincenzi
        .<br />
        <br /><br />
        The proposal of inviting Obama to Christopher Columbus' birthplace was immediate, and a significant move. <br />
        That could have important consequences, because Genoa has been involved in battles for civil rights in the last
        few months while also trying to restore its relationship with the United States, which have often been
        identified as a symbol of evil globalization since the G8 summit [held in the city in 2001].&#8221;<br />
        <br /><br />
        After Bush &ndash; the &#8220;king&#8221; president among the other 8 powers protected by the Red Zone [the
        restricted area of the city where the G8 summit was held] &ndash; a black presidential candidate who speaks of
        dialog and integration to the people of Genova (and obviously also tens of thousands of Italians), from De
        Ferrari Square [the city's main square]. [&#8230;]&quot;

<p>This could be a truly important occasion for Genova (and Italy) to re-establish dialog with the United States after
    the G8 summit (which cost the city a death and millions of Euro of damage caused by vandalism).<br />
    However, there is still no official confirmation that the event will take place at all, especially due to the
    upcoming Presidential Elections in the same period.</p>
<p>If he comes, I'll definitely be there!</p>
