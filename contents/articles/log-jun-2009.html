<p>Welcome to yet another of my extremely boring, excessively fragmented personal log posts. I&#8217;m seriously
	thinking of dropping the whole series in favor of more frequent (and shorter) blog posts, starting from next year.
	This means you&#8217;ll probably have to read <em>another six</em> of these priceless gems, until december
	2009.<br />
	As usual, feel free to skim through as each of the following <em>sections</em> is almost completely unrelated to the
	others.</p>
<h3>H3RALD Web Site v8.0</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s the time of the year, again. It doesn&#8217;t happen <em>every</em> year but it&#8217;s definitely a trend
	(hence the high version number): I&#8217;m going to redesign &amp; redevelop my web site.</p>
<p>This time is not the usual &#8220;Let&#8217;s pick another language and another framework and start from
	scratch&#8221;, but a rather more radical shift, and yet at the same time less painful. The idea is to transform
	H3RALD.com into a 100% static web site, without losing anything in functionality (gaining, if anything!).</p>
<p><a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> is definitely <em>not</em> the first person to <a
		href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">blog like a hacker</a>, and his very
	own <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is definitely not the first static web site generator our there,
	nevertheless, he inspired me to embrace what seems to be one of the latest trend in developer&#8217;s blogs.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: turn all the blog posts and pages into static content, and rely on third party web services for
	things like comments, search etc. For a rather extreme by very interesting example, see <a
		href="http://tagaholic.me/">Tagaholic</a>.</p>
<p>The advantages of this approach are many:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Free yourself from a database.</li>
	<li>Free yourself from a resource-hungry, server-side app (<a href="http://wiki.github.com/fdv/typo/">Typo</a>, in
		this case).</li>
	<li>Increase speed and reliability, without using caching or similar artifacts.</li>
	<li>Keep everything under version control.</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t worry about breaking things when upgrading (even if the static content generator changes, it
		shouldn&#8217;t really break things).</li>
	<li>Unleash the power of client-side scripting (namely, JQuery).</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I&#8217;m just brainstorming a little bit on <a
		href="http://github.com/h3rald/h3rald-website/issues">GitHub</a>, feel free to participate. The first step is
	obviously choosing a static content generator, and atm Jekyll seems to be slightly ahead of Webby. Opinions?</p>
<h3>Glyph</h3>
<p>Did you ever want to write a short manual or a book, or even a long article? If so, chances are you gave LaTeX a shot
	and either fully embraced its philosophy or totally refused it. Sadly, I belong to the second category: I believe
	sequential documents like manuals or books should be easier to create simply by using <span
		class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<p>Whever I have a chance to actually start working on it, Glyph will become a <em>document authoring framework</em>,
	i.e. a way to create visually appealing documents in a simple way. All the ingredients are there, it&#8217;s only
	necessary to glue them together in a pretty form:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Textile (and <a href="http://redcloth.org/">RedCloth</a>) to produce clean <span class="caps">HTML</span> code
		from a human-readable markup</li>
	<li>CSS3 to specify page rules</li>
	<li>A few rake scripts to produce a standalone <span class="caps">HTML</span> file, <span class="caps">TOC</span>,
		Index etc.</li>
	<li>An internal <span class="caps">DSL</span> for the document structure and metadata</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> for control flow, snippets and filters</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a> to generate a <span class="caps">PDF</span> from <span
			class="caps">HTML</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This project is still in planning stage, feel free to have a look at the <a
		href="http://github.com/h3rald/glyph/issues">issues/features page</a> on GitHub. Feedback is appreciated, as
	usual.</p>
<h3>Vim files &amp; <em>the Stash</em></h3>
<p>If you read the previous two sections of this post, you may have noticed that I&#8217;m growing more and more fond of
	git (and GitHub). Besides the repositories I already mentioned earlier on, I also created a personal <a
		href="http://github.com/h3rald/stash">stash</a>, which I&#8217;m using mainly to store some of my Linux
	dotfiles, article drafts and &#8230;Vim customizations.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a color scheme for Vim, check out my very own <a
		href="/herald-vim-color-scheme">herald.vim</a>, and tell me what you think.</p>
<h3>Getting ready for the Big Step</h3>
<p>This will probably be my last post as a free man, as I&#8217;m getting married (civilly) on July 2nd and
	(religiously) on July 11th. <br />
	Luckily the photographer agreed to give us a CD with all the pictures taken on the big day, with no copyright
	restrictions attached to it (believe it or not, some photographers don&#8217;t allow you to republish <em>your
		own</em> photos unless you ask them first), so I&#8217;ll probably write a long post with pictures when we come
	back from our (half) honeymoon.</p>
<p>Everything is pretty much organized. We had troubles with the waistcoats we got from eBay: they were cut almost
	randomly to <em>resamble</em> waistcoats, but they weren&#8217;t so we had to re-order another lot of 7 sets
	(waistcoat, cravat <em>and</em> shirt this time) from another seller, this time UK-based. I seriously hope to get
	them in time.</p>
<p>On the 24th we&#8217;re having a party at our house. If you were invited, feel free to drop by, otherwise be prepared
	to be thrown out of the window (4th floor) by one of our ushers (Roxanne&#8217;s <em>big</em> brother). It&#8217;s
	probalby going to be about 30-40 people in the end, mainly because most of my office can&#8217;t come due to
	holidays they booked in advance.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s left to do now? Well:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Send the bomboniere over to Ireland</li>
	<li>Make sure my dad actually ships the 96 specially-bottled bottles of our own wine to uncle John, in Ireland.</li>
	<li>Make sure uncle John doesn&#8217;t drink all the 96 bottles of wine before the wedding reception.</li>
	<li>Make sure my best man understood that the speech he has do make <em>must</em> be in English, at least 3 minutes
		long and not too offensive to the groom.</li>
	<li>Pay a huge, colossal heap of money for the whole thing. It&#8217;s going to cost us (and my dad) quite a bit, in
		the end. But it&#8217;s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, after all (getting totally trashed in a fancy hotel
		with all your family, including 2nd and 3rd grade cousins).</li>
</ul>
