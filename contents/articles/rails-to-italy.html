<p>So it looks like there will be a &#8220;Rails conference in Italy&#8221;, after all. In Pisa as well, and that&#8217;s maybe even less than 2 hours drive from where I live (Genoa)!</p>
<p><em>Sounds cool!</em></p>
<p>Well, the entrance fee put me off a bit, I daresay (â‚¬89 if you book before August 1st, more otherwise), but it would be great to go there.<br />
They are actually looking for speakers too, pity that at the moment I don&#8217;t have anything prepared, but who knows&#8230; There&#8217;s free entrance (and beer) for speakers, apparently, which it wouldn&#8217;t be bad, but unfortunately my girlfriend would have to pay though, of course.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see what happens, for now I&#8217;m just going to promote the thing on my site (see the banner on the side).</p>
