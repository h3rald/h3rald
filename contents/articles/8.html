<p>Yes, it works. Perhaps it&#8217;s a tiny bit slower than expected but the new h3raLd.com seems to work.<br />
I&#8217;ll probably find some new exciting bugs to fix in the next few hours, as usual &#8211; that will be annoying but perfectly normal.</p>
<p><del>The good thing is that the new template seems to load faster, mostly due to the fact that I hardly used images</del> &lt;- [not true, te new site appears to be slower, maybe not due to the images], at any rate, let&#8217;s see how it goes. I can imagine I&#8217;ll have to implement some sort of caching system for the tagging system in particular, but fortunately <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> apparently comes with a built-in caching mechanism for views, models etc. etc. although the documentation available seems to be <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/f0f96751bb61bc7b/bcb43c97e91923c7?q=caching&amp;rnum=1#bcb43c97e91923c7">scarce</a> at the moment, and I&#8217;ve been to lazy to investigate any further.</p>
