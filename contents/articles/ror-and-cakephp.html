<p>This article is an attempt to port a famous Ruby on Rails tutorial to <span class="caps">PHP</span> using an emerging <span class="caps">PHP</span> <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework, CakePHP. CakePHP was inspired by Rails&#8217; philosophy of Rapid Application Development. It implements a lot of the features and concepts that made Ruby on Rails popular in a very short time. Although Ruby&#8217;s syntax and way of doing things is known to be much more elegant than other programming languages, there is yet hope for <span class="caps">PHP</span> to get more organized and effi cient. This tutorial will follow its Rails counterpart step-by-step, covering the essential steps to create a simple, yet fully functional, web application.<br />
