<p>The Ruby Compendium has been updated, and it now lists the most up-to-date versions of various Ruby implementatios, even more web sites, books, podcasts, and Rubyists. In addition to the <span class="caps">PDF</span> version, the book can now be read online <a href="/ruby-compendium/book/">here on H3RALD.com</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a relatively minor update; however, I felt it was a good time to release it to keep the book up-to-date.</p>
