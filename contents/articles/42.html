<p>I am sorry to announce that my upcoming book, CakePHP Recipes, will not be published anymore. As a matter of fact, it
    wasn't finished because some of the people involved failed to comply with the terms of their contract in delivering
    material which was suitable for publication.</p>
<p>To quote an email I received from my publisher a few days ago,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;[&#8230;] The Cake Software Foundation has informed us they are withdrawing from the CakePHP Recipes
        project, and returning the advances they've received. This means we can no longer count on them for support, nor
        can we package the book as an official title.</em></p>
<p><em>After careful consideration, we have determined that this renders the book no longer viable for us. So,
        regrettably we must cancel your contract as well. Please understand that we have no quarrel with your
        performance; you have been responsive and communicative for the entire time. [&#8230;]&quot;</em></p>
<p>This is a huge disappointment to me, in particular because I am not responsible for the cancellation. It was going to
    be my very first book to be published, and due to someone else's misjudgement and lack of motivation it will never
    be available to the readers.<br />
    I do not want to put the blame the whole Cake Software Foundation for this: nearly every person involved in the
    project did his best in reviewing parts of the book or offering me support. Regrettably this wasn't enough:
    unfortunately it seems that someone didn't like the idea of me writing the book and kept doubting not only my coding
    skills but also my ability as a writer all along.</p>
<p>It is sad to see how certain individuals fail to understand the importance of marketing and public relations not only
    when working on a team project but also in ordinary life, but it is truly disappointing to see how the thoughts and
    opinions of a single individual affect the work of a whole team.</p>
