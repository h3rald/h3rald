<p>Lately I've been reading quite a bit about Rails' <span class="caps">REST</span> approach, and to be totally honest
	I'm not 100% convinced it can always be a good idea. The purpose of this post is to re-evaluate the situation, and
	ask other people their opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>Let's see&#8230;</p>
<h3>Key Benefits</h3>
<p>To cut a long story short, from my understanding <span class="caps">REST</span> can be a good thing because:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It introduces the powerful concept of &#8220;resources&#8221;, which is independent from the presentation. This
		basically means that you can have your &#8220;resources&#8221; represented in <span class="caps">HTML</span>.
		<span class="caps">XML</span> etc. etc. &#8220;for free&#8221;. If you are making an extensive use of web
		services, this is truly a bless.</li>
	<li>Each <span class="caps">CRUD</span> action is carried out using a different <span class="caps">HTTP</span>
		command (get, post, put and delete). At present, because most browsers don't understand <span
			class="caps">PUT</span> or <span class="caps">DELETE</span> requested, this is somehow simulated by Rails.
	</li>
	<li>By thinking and modeling your application in terms of resources, everything should always be &#8220;in the right
		place&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides?</h3>
<p>Let's now try to summarize what made me think more carefully this approach&#8230;</p>
<ul>
	<li>While I really like Rails' convention over configuration philosophy, this sounds a tiny bit too extreme for me.
		In the end it could be good, but it requires developers to completely re-think the way they develop their
		application in order to be 100% RESTful.</li>
	<li>URLs aren't that pretty anymore. While <a
			href="http://themysteriouswaysofruby.blogspot.com/2007/04/pretty-restful-urls-in-rails.html">someone</a>
		suggested a way to improve the way RESTful URLs look, that sounds like extra hassle to me. It's subjective, I
		know, but I really don't like using IDs in the url&#8230; I'd rather go for an univocal code any day (check out
		this site&#8230; I don't even like dates in my blog).</li>
	<li>Sometimes, it may take quite a bit to figure out how to model some functionality using resources. While it is
		straightforward when you want to perform <span class="caps">CRUD</span> operations, modeling a search action or
		authentication may be a bit tricky and may also feel a bit forced. Again, maybe it's just me.</li>
	<li>It may be a bit too early to take full advantage of this approach. <span class="caps">PUT</span> and <span
			class="caps">DELETE</span> are simulated, and this doesn't sound right &#8212; agreed, that's the only way
		for now, but it still sounds like a forceful workaround. Browsers are not RESTful (yet)!</li>
	<li>All resources are virtually accessible by a <span class="caps">URL</span>. I'm not a security expert, but this
		scares me a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some posts which made me think a bit:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/04/looking-for-good-argument-against-rest.html">Looking for a
			good argument against <span class="caps">REST</span></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ipbabble.com/2007/07/restful_myths.html">RESTful Myths: Unraveling the Confusion</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blog.livollmers.net/index.php/2007/06/26/why-cant-web-apps-be-rest-ful/">Why Canâ€™t Web Apps Be
			<span class="caps">REST</span>-ful?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is: is <span class="caps">REST</span> really worth the hassle? Especially for small and simple
	applications like a blog, is it really worthwhile to coerce myself to adopt a RESTful approach when I could
	accomplish exactly the same things with much less hassle?</p>
<p>In other words, is <span class="caps">REST</span> really the answer to everything or in <em>some cases</em> it is
	just <em>not necessary</em>?</p>
<p>And also (OK, this may sound harsh and impolite): does it really make sense to push people to adopt a RESTful
	approach no matter what? Sometimes someone may get the feeling that Rails is all about <span
		class="caps">REST</span> now. Is that true, or is there still room for <del>freedom</del> other views?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hear your comments, but please be nice and civilized!</p>
