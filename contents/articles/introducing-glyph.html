<p>I&#8217;ve been writing technical documents for a living for the past four years, and I can tell you: there is no
	easy way to go about it.</p>
<p>For example, you can use:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>a Word Processor</strong> like MS Word, for example &#8212; anyone can do that, right? Sure, but no,
		thanks: I strongly believe that Word Processors should not be used for writing technical documents as I firmly
		don&#8217;t believe GUIs are suitable for doing this at a professional level.</li>
	<li><strong>a Document Authoring Software</strong> like Adobe Framemaker, Robohelp, etc. Still GUIs, only more
		complicated to use.</li>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">XML</span>, like <span class="caps">DITA</span> or DocBook, or other
			markups</strong>, like ReStructuredText. Better, but still not easily extensible and flexible enough.</li>
	<li><strong>your company&#8217;s tools</strong>, if you have them. That&#8217;s great if they are usable enough and
		the result makes your boss happy.</li>
	<li><strong>LaTeX</strong>, and that&#8217;s probably your best option, if you know what you&#8217;re doing.</li>
	<li><strong><span class="caps">XHTML</span> and CSS3</strong>, in conjunction with a <span class="caps">PDF</span>
		renderer like <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince <span class="caps">XML</span></a> &#8212; that&#8217;s
		great if you know <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and you don&#8217;t mind
		hand-crafting the structure of the document.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lightweight markups</h3>
<p>I love Textile and Markdown. When people aren&#8217;t looking, I even use them at work to generate <span
		class="caps">HTML</span> code, because it&#8217;s just so much faster. Textile in particular can be used as a
	drop-in replacement for <span class="caps">HTML</span> (and a bit of LaTeX, too), as it can produce most inline
	<span class="caps">HTML</span> tags effortlessly and some block-level tags, too.</p>
<p>For things like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags and <code>&lt;tables&gt;</code> though, Textile is not the best thing
	in the world, so you normally end up falling back to <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<p>Another &#8220;problem&#8221; is that <strong>Textile</strong> or other similar lightweight markups cannot be
	extended easily, simply because they were not meant to be extended in the first place.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are producing a book, Textile can&#8217;t help you if you want to generate things like a Table of
	Contents automatically or validate links: those things are simply not part of Textile&#8217;s job.</p>
<h3>How Glyph can help</h3>
<p style="float:right;"><img src="/images/pictures/glyph.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are a few projects on the Internet that tackle structured document generation. One of them is <a
		href="http://github.com/fnando/kitabu">Kitabu</a>, which looks promising and is able to produce pretty documents
	using Textile and Prince for <span class="caps">PDF</span> rendering&#8230; but again, it&#8217;s not extensible
	because it relies too much on Textile and Markdown.</p>
<p><a href="/glyph/">Glyph</a> is different. For one, it is much younger than any other, therefore it is most likely
	full of bugs.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, Glyph follows a much more radical approach, which consists in using a <em>macro language</em> on top of
	Textile or Markdown. The good thing about it is that this macro language is very simple to learn and &#8212; most
	importantly &#8212; very easy to extend.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<div class='text'>
	<pre><code>section[header[Something about Glyph]
You can use Glyph macros in conjunction
 with _Textile_ or _Markdown_ to
produce HTML files effortlessly.
  section[header[What about PDFs?|pdf]
Once you have a single, well-formatted HTML 
file, converting it to PDF is
extremely easy with a 3rd-party 
renderer like =&gt;[http://www.princexml.com|Prince].
  ]   
]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Which translates to:</p>
<div class='html'>
	<pre><code>&lt;div class="section"&gt;
  &lt;h2 id="h_1"&gt;Something about Glyph&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can use Glyph macros in conjunction with 
     &lt;em&gt;Textile&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; to
     produce HTML files effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="section"&gt;
   &lt;h3 id="pdf"&gt;What about PDFs?&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Once you have a single, well-formatted HTML 
      file, converting it to PDF is
      extremely easy with a 3rd-party renderer 
      like &lt;a href="http://www.princexml.com"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Glyph macros can be used to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Generate block-level <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags not commonly managed by lightweight markups, like
		<code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>div</code> and <code>table</code>.</li>
	<li>Create and validate internal and external links.</li>
	<li>Include and validate images and figures.</li>
	<li>Automatically determine header levels based on the document structure.</li>
	<li>Automatically generate a Table of Contents based on the document structure.</li>
	<li>Store common snippets of text in a single <span class="caps">YAML</span> file and use them anywhere in your
		document, as many times as you need.</li>
	<li>Store configuration settings in a <span class="caps">YAML</span> file and use them anywhere in your document, as
		many times as you need.</li>
	<li>Evaluate Ruby code within your document.</li>
	<li>Call macros from other macros (including snippets), carefully avoiding mutual calls.</li>
	<li>Include text files in other text files.</li>
	<li>Include the contents of configuration settings (author, title) in the document.</li>
	<li>Filter input explicitly or implicitly, based on file extensions when including files.</li>
	<li>Manage comments and todo items.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example Glyph project? Sure, Glyph&#8217;s own guide (<a
		href="https://github.com/h3rald/glyph/tree/master/book/">source</a> &#8212; <a
		href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/h3rald/glyph/glyph.pdf"><span class="caps">PDF</span> output</a>).</p>
<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<p>Glyph is built on top of the following Ruby Gems:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gli">gli</a> &#8212; For the high-level command line interface.</li>
	<li><a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a> &#8212; For the mid-level interdependent task layer.</li>
	<li><a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">treetop</a> &#8212; For parsing Glyph Language, whose grammar is <a
			href="http://github.com/h3rald/glyph/blob/master/lib/glyph/glyph_language.treetop">ridiculously simple</a>,
		but it seems to work so far.</li>
	<li><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/extlib/">extlib</a> &#8212; Because I can&#8217;t leave without it.</li>
</ul>
