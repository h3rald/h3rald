<p>Quite a bit of time passed since the last blog post, and I&#8217;m actually sorry about that, but as I thought, I don&#8217;t have as much free time as I used to be. Work is work, after all!<br />
This post will be multipurpose as actually I bluid up a few things to write about in the last few days&#8230; erhm, ok, <em>weeks</em>.</p>
<h3>New Website Design</h3>
<p>Something different eh? Yep, definitely! Some time ago I started a small project called <a href="/projects/view/h3rald-redesign">h3raLd.com Re-design</a> hoping that some <span class="caps">GFX</span> guru could provide a new template for this website, and actually in the end I decided to accept the work of <em><strong>Bartus F. Teipel</strong></em> a Brazilian CakePHP enthusiast.<br />
Bartus is obviously (<span class="caps">MUCH</span>) more talented than me when it comes to design, and I was amazed at the quality of the template he provided, in a really short time. <br />
Unfortunately he didn&#8217;t yet provide a link to his main website/portfolio, but for now all I can show you is his website for party pics, <a href="http://www.circuscircus.com.br/">CircusCircus</a>.</p>
<p>The new template sports a more contemporary Web2.0-ish look which I like a lot, and Bartus used libraries like <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype</a>, <a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">moo.fx</a> and <a href="http://www.html.it/articoli/niftycube/index.html">Nifty Corners Cube</a> for the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> effects and functionalities. <br />
A really outstanding work, thanks Bartus!</p>
<h3>The CakePHP Herald project has been completed</h3>
<p>With my <a href="http://www.h3rald.com/articles/view/cakephp-first-bite/">latest article</a> about CakePHP published on SitePoint, the <a href="/projects/view/cakephp-herald/">CakePHP Herald</a> project was completed.<br />
I must say that I really enjoyed writing all those articles about CakePHP, and the only thing I regret is not to have written anything (yet) about some more advanced topic about CakePHP. This was mostly due to &#8211; again &#8211; lack of time to focus on advanced topic and produce some quality examples.</p>
<p>However, judging by the positive feedback I received about the articles, I am really happy of the final result: even more people discovered the power of CakePHP and became <em>bakers</em>. Happy baking to all of you!</p>
<p><em>So&#8230; no more articles about Cake?</em> Maybe not for a while, I think I&#8217;ll be rather busy in the following months. Curious? Read on :-)</p>
<h3>My biggest and most important project</h3>
<p>I actually got really pissed off with Larry, Garret &amp; the other Master Bakers because of what they wrote on the <a href="http://cakeforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=244">announcement</a> for the latest CakePHP release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[&#8230;]In other news, some new articles were published on Sitepoint <sup class="footnote" id="fnr3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> and in the International <span class="caps">PHP</span> magazine <sup class="footnote" id="fnr4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. Fabio Cevasco <sup class="footnote" id="fnr5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> is the man behind these articles. Together with Fabio, we will be writing a book that will be published [&#8230;]&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all this time I spent <em>trying desperately not to say a word about it</em> they came out and heralded it out of nowhere. Sigh&#8230; they ruined the surprise effect! Oh well, it&#8217;s too late now, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>So yes, when I say that I&#8217;m spending at least 60% of my time (at work and at home) writing I really mean it. The rest? Well, I do have a lovely girlfriend after all!!!</p>
