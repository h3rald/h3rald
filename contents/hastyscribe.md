[](class:hastyscribe) is a simple, self-contained, command-line program able to convert [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files into self-contained HTML pages, automatically embedding all the needed fonts, stylesheets and images.

HastyScribe is:

* **cross-platform**, you can download precompiled binaries for macOS, Linux and Windows.
* **self-contained**, it's a command-line application that doesn't require installing or prerequisites: it's all in a single, small, executable file.
* a **powerful markdown compiler**, which leverages the feature-rich [Discount](https://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) markdown engine, and adds even more features like snippets, custom fields, and substitution macros.
* able to generate **self-contained, responsive HTML5 documents** that can be viewed with any major modern broswer, and look great on any device.

For more information and a sample of HastyScribe's power, you can download and read the [HastyScribe User Guide](/hastyscribe/HastyScribe_UserGuide.htm) &ndash; generated with HastyScribe of course.
