<p>One of the best things about Ruby is that you&#8217;re not stuck with a single programming paradigm. Even though everything in Ruby is an object (thereby making it a fully object-oriented language), nothing forbids you to program procedurally, or even use typical functional constructs.</p>
<p>The beauty of this is that you can (and should) combine elements from different paradigms, resulting in very powerful and expressive code. What I really like about Ruby though is its inherent dynamic nature.</p>
<p>You have a very few constraints when coding:</p>
<ul>
	<li>you can open and close class definitions at will,</li>
	<li>you are not constrained by object types</li>
	<li>you can mix-in methods in multiple classes at the same time</li>
	<li>you can write code that <em>writes itself</em> dynamically (this is commonly called <em>metaprogramming</em>)</li>
	<li>you can easily create Domain-Specific Language to solve problems faster, with style</li>
	<li>you can create and pass around blocks of code</li>
</ul>
<p>All these things make the language very flexible and powerful. Do not overuse Ruby&#8217;s power: if your code starts to look like black magic, you&#8217;re probably going too far.</p>
