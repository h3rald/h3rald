<p>Ruby is a relatively new programming language. It was created by <a
		href="/ruby-compendium/book/rubyists.html#matz">Yukihiro Matzumoto</a> (aka &#8220;Matz&#8221;) in 1995, but it
	took another ten years to become popular outside Japan, thanks to the <em>Ruby on Rails</em> web framework.</p>

	<div class="box-title">Isn't Ruby <em>slow?</em></div>
	<p>Being a high-level, interpreted language, Ruby is slower than compiled languages like C or C++ or even other
		interpreted languages like Perl 5. However, this may vary depending on the implementation.</p>
