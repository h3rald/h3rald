                <p>Welcome to H3RALD.com. This site was used to be a fairly active blog back in the early 2000s, but sadly I progressively lost interest in writing articles, perhaps because I didn't have anything new to write about that you couldn't find elsewhere. However, all the content is still here, so feel free to browse through the <a href="/articles">articles</a> section.</p>
                <p>As I progressively neglected writing, I started creating more and more small programs and tools to perform common tasks, mostly using the <a href="https://nim-lang.org" target="_blank">Nim</a> programming language. They are all open source and they all have a dedicated project page here, and there's some pretty decent documentation for most of them. You can find them all in the <a href="/projects">projects</a> section.</p>
                <p>At any rate, thank you for stopping by!</p>
